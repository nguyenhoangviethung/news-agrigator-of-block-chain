Institutional investors can overcome most of the barriers that have been preventing large-scale investments in cryptocurrencies.\n\nETFs removed barriers such as custodial challenges and regulatory uncertainty to attract more investors. You can learn more about the importance of ETH ETF by exploring the prominent highlights they can introduce in crypto markets. Let us dive deeper into the impact of ETH ETFs on crypto markets and Ethereum technology.\n\nThe benefits of Ethereum exchange traded funds suggest that the announcement of ETH ETF approval might have resulted in positive trends. However, the immediate reaction of the crypto market to ETF approval indicated mixed responses as the price of ETH tokens declined after the announcement. The contradictory response might have been a resultant of market modifications tailored to the growing influx of institutional investors. The growing recognition for Ethereum ETFs among institutional investors could lead to significant rise in pricing of Ether.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nNotable doubts regarding ETFs such as “Is Ethereum good for long run?” may have investors thinking twice before adopting ETH ETFs. The influx of institutional investment would spell positive news for the Ethereum ecosystem albeit with certain formidable concerns. ETFs create the risk of increasing centralization which may challenge the principles of decentralization that define the Ethereum blockchain network.\n\nRegulatory scrutiny of ETFs might be an attractive highlight for institutional investors. ETF approval by a regulatory authority offers the assurance of security to investors. On the other hand, institutional investors would have to follow rigorous KYC and AML requirements. Increased regulatory oversight also presents a formidable setback for the decentralization ethos of the Ethereum network.\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs marked a major milestone in regulatory advancements for crypto-related assets. The advantages of ETH ETFs stem from the approval by regulatory authorities as it boosts positive market sentiment. Regulatory authorities will continue to play a significant role in defining the future of Ethereum ETFs. Investors must stay updated with the latest news about crypto regulations and price movements in the market to make informed decisions.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the popular blockchain network, Ethereum, and ensure overall, comprehensive skill development with Ethereum Skill Path\n\nEthereum ETFs might have gained popularity for their advantages. It is also important to identify the potential risks that come with ETFs. One of the foremost factors that outweighs the benefits of Ethereum ETF is market volatility. The cryptocurrency market is vulnerable to erratic price fluctuations and speculations. On top of it, regulatory changes in the form of policy shifts can bring new challenges for ETH ETFs.\n\nInnovation would be the best solution to deal with such risks. The broader economic implications of ETH ETFs can increase investment in new projects. Innovation can help Ethereum ETFs stay strong in the volatile crypto market landscape. Ultimately, the blend of innovation and investment would fuel the growth of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum exchange traded funds or ETFs have the potential to bring more investors to the crypto market. Retail and institutional investors have been refraining from crypto investments due to a broad range of barriers. For example, regulatory uncertainty regarding cryptocurrencies, volatility of the crypto market and technical complexities. The importance of Ethereum ETF in the broader financial ecosystem is evident in the fact that it bridges the gap between crypto and traditional finance.\n\nThe approval for Ethereum ETFs would lead to promising improvements in the Ethereum ecosystem, supported by the strong technical infrastructure of Ethereum. At the same time, it is also important to look out for potential risks such as possibilities of centralization and regulatory changes.

    "content": "Risk assets slid Thursday as China\u0027s second interest-rate cut in a week sparked concerns of instability in the world\u0027s second-largest economy.\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell almost 2% since midnight UTC to around $64,000 and ether (ETH) dropped more than 5%, dragging the wider altcoin market lower. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, lost 4.6% in 24 hours.\n\nIn equity markets, Germany\u0027s DAX, France\u0027s CAC and the eurozone\u0027s Euro Stoxx 50 fell over 1.5%, and futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 were slightly lower after the index\u0027s 3% slide on Wednesday, according to data source Investing.com.\n\nEarly Thursday, the People\u0027s Bank of China (PBoC) announced a surprise, off-schedule cut in its one-year medium-term lending facility rate to 2.3% from 2.5%, injecting 200 billion yuan ($27.5 billion) of liquidity into the market. That\u0027s the biggest reduction since 2020.\n\nThe move, along with similar reductions in other borrowing rates early this week, shows urgency among policymakers to shore up growth after its recent third plenum offered little hope of a boost. Data released early this month showed China\u0027s economy expanded by 4.7% in the second quarter at an annualized pace, much weaker than the estimated 5.1%, and slower than first quarter\u0027s 5.3%.\n\n\"Equity futures are stable after yesterday\u0027s bloody session that shook views across all asset classes,\" Ilan Solot, senior global strategist at Marex Solutions, said in a note shared with CoinDesk. \"The decision by the PBoC to cut rates in a surprise move only added to the sense of panic.\" Marex Solutions, a division of global financial platform Marex, specializes in creating and distributing customized derivatives products and issuing crypto-linked structured products.\n\nSolot noted the ongoing \"steepening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve\" as a threat to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, echoing CoinDesk\u0027s reporting from early this month.\n\nThe yield curve steepens when the difference between longer-duration and shorter-duration bond yields increases. This month, the spread between 10-year and two-year Treasury yields has risen by 20 basis points to -0.12 basis points (bps), mainly due to stickier 10-year yields.\n\nThe so-called de-inversion or re-steepening from inversion (or negative spread) has historically coincided with risk aversion.\n\n\"For me, the biggest concern is the shape of the U.S. yield curve, which continues steepening. The 2- and 10-year curve is not only -12bps inverted, compared to -50bps just last month. The recent moves have been led by rising back-end [10y] yields and falling short-end ones,\" Solot said.\n\nThat\u0027s a sign markets expect the Fed to cut rates but see stickier inflation and expansionary fiscal policy as growing risks, Solot said.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Key Interest Rate Decisions Coming This Week From Fed, BOJ, BOE",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The Fed is expected to hold policy steady but indicate a soon-to-come rate cut, while the Bank of England is seen as about a 50/50 bet to ease and the Bank of Japan is likely to either hike rates or signal an imminent move.\n\n",
    "content": "Three major central banks are holding policy meetings this week and the results from each are anticipated to be at least somewhat different.\n\nThe first decision is set to come Wednesday (Tuesday evening in the U.S.) from the Bank of Japan and analysts are split on whether the BOJ will either raise its policy rate from the current 0%-0.1% or send a signal that a rate hike is soon to come. What\u0027s known is that inflation in Japan has been above the bank\u0027s 2% target for some time and the yen – though rallying of late – continues to hover near multi-decade lows versus the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe WSJ also reported that the BOJ believes tighter monetary policy could boost sluggish consumption in Japan as higher rates would further buoy the yen and ease the prices of key imports like gasoline and food.\n\nNext up will the decision by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon (U.S. hours). While virtually no one sees the Fed as cutting the fed funds rate for the first time since 2020, nearly all anticipate the U.S. central bank as indicating its expectation that it will trim rates at its next meeting in mid-September.\n\nIndeed, current rate cut odds for September are at 100%, according to CME FedWatch, with a 12% chance the Fed trims by 50 basis points instead of the customary 25.\n\nEarly Thursday afternoon in the U.K. will bring the Bank of England\u0027s policy decision and both economists and rate markets are split roughly 50/50 on whether that central bank will ease policy for the first time in several years. What\u0027s more certain is that even if the BOE does cut rates, it\u0027s likely to indicate a very cautious approach, i.e. indicating to markets that a string of easings should not be yet expected.\n\nBarring a surprise such as, for instance, the Fed indicating that a September rate cut is not yet a sure thing, bitcoin (BTC) prices may not be affected that much by the central bank news this week.\n\nLonger term, though, it appears that at least a modest series of rate cuts across all major central banks except the BOJ are the new norm. In addition to developments at the Fed and BOE, the European Central Bank trimmed its policy rate earlier this summer and the Bank of Canada has cut twice in the past few months.\n\nAll things being equal, easier monetary policy tends to be good for risk assets such as bitcoin. Markets do tend to anticipate though, and while bitcoin\u0027s 56% year-to-date rally is commonly mostly attributed to demand from the U.S.-based spot ETFs, at least some of that move may have come on the expectation that Western monetary policy was about to enter an easing cycle after a multi-year tightening trend.\n\n\n\n",

    "summary": "Following the highly anticipated 2024 Bitcoin Conference, a notable spike in positive market sentiment drove the Bitcoin price to $70,000.\n\n",
    "content": "Following the highly anticipated 2024 Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, over the weekend, a notable spike in positive market sentiment drove the Bitcoin price to a one-month high of $70,000 on Monday.\n\nAnalysts are now eyeing the potential for an extended super-cycle, with market expert Doctor Profit suggesting that the recent rally could begin a significant uptrend with plenty of room to run.\n\nAccording to a recent report by Doctor Profit, the current price action is the first phase of this potential super cycle, noting that during the 2021 bull run, he had accurately predicted Bitcoin’s crash to around $18,000, followed by the capitulation event triggered by the FTX collapse, where it hit $15,400.\n\n“At this point, I posted that I am going all in with the 2021 bull market gains back into the market at prices between $16,000 and $18,000,” Doctor Profit stated. “This bottom price is historically significant and unlikely to be revisited.”\n\nThe analyst further explained the various phases of the current market cycle, highlighting the “pre-bull” phase characterized by resistance at $38,500, which needed to be breached to enter the second pre-bull phase.\n\nDoctor Profit believes that this phase was driven by significant buying activity from Binance, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Justin Sun, and Bitfinex whales, as well as the filing of the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by BlackRock in June 2023.\n\nThe “Golden Bull” phase, as seen in the chart above, followed the approval of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF and saw the entry of traditional financial players into the crypto market, leaving the $48,000 to $74,000 range as one of the most crucial support levels that will be defended during the upcoming bull market, according to the analyst.\n\n“This region of golden bull will mark, or be very close to the Bitcoin bottom for the incoming bear market,” Doctor Profit explained. “Again, this region is BlackRock investors’ entry, and at all cost they will defend it during this bull market.”\n\nConsidering these levels that could support BTC’s price in the coming months, Doctor Profit’s technical analysis points out that the initial target for this super cycle is set at the $86,000 threshold, with projections ranging between $110,000 and $120,000 in a conservative scenario.\n\nHowever, Doctor Profit noted that in the most optimistic scenario, the Bitcoin price could soar between $180,000 and $220,000 if the price surges above $70,000 and consolidates above this milestone.\n\nAdding to the bullish sentiment, a recent report by CoinShares showed that Bitcoin has seen healthy inflows of $519 million in the past week, bringing its month-to-date inflows to $3.6 billion and year-to-date inflows to a record $19 billion.\n\nThe firm noted that this surge in inflows and investor confidence could be attributed to the potential use of BTC by the US government as a strategic reserve asset following Donald Trump’s speech on Saturday, as well as the increased likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September 2024.\n\nAs reported by our sister site Bitcoinist, former US President Donald Trump reiterated his plans to create a national Bitcoin stash and turn the cryptocurrency into a strategic reserve asset for the US dollar.\n\nTrump also promised that the US government would retain ownership of all BTC in custody rather than participate in a market sell-off that could ultimately affect price action and potential upward movement.\n\nAt the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $68,800, registering price gains of 1.3% and 2.3% in the 24-hour and 7-day time frames, respectively.\n\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com\n\n",

    "title": "Meet Mike Novogratz, the Political Commentator",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "In an interview at Consensus 2024, the Galaxy Digital CEO was asked about a plethora of regulatory and legislative issues affecting crypto.\n\n",
    "content": "AUSTIN, Texas – You might think, given Mike Novogratz’s penchant for wrestling, that he’d pick a team when it comes to politics and take his opponents to the mat. After all, we’re talking about the guy who once got a tattoo of doomed-to-fail stablecoin project Terra/LUNA – he doesn’t mind taking sides. But instead, Novogratz describes himself as a “radical centrist.”\n\n“I am broadly a center-left Democrat … but I\u0027ve donated to Republican candidates,” Novogratz said Thursday on the Main Stage at Consensus 2024. In other words, if Novogratz has a team, it’s crypto, making the Galaxy Digital CEO a kind of “single issue” voter.\n\nRead more: RFK Jr. Says Guilty Verdict May Help Trump\u0027s Election Prospects\n\nThere are many voters in the U.S. who are increasingly concerned about how the asset class has become a political wedge issue. So many so that it appears that the laser-eyed focus of bag holders, perpetual industry lobbying and recent endorsement by former President Donald Trump have helped soften many Democratic officeholders’ stance on crypto.\n\n“There\u0027s been a seismic shift in the political landscape in the last two weeks.” Novogratz said. “I\u0027ve been in D.C. trying to tell people this is a bipartisan issue,” but over the years the Democrats seem to have lost the plot. Or as Novogratz said by way of comparison, “the Democratic party was the party that doesn\u0027t like dogs.”\n\nIndeed, the legislative and regulatory advancements of recent weeks – including the House and Senate vote to repeal the maligned accounting bulletin SAB121, the House passing a crypto bill, major progress for ETH ETFs and President Joe Biden’s reported outreach to crypto firms looking for guidance on saner policy – happened bing-bang-boom.\n\n“I don\u0027t know what happened,” Novogratz said. “It certainly feels like someone from the White House called Mr. Gensler [SEC Chairman] and said, ‘You got to change your stance,’” Novogratz said. Likewise, “Elizabeth Warren had a huge sway over presidential politics,” but unfortunately for the Massachusetts Senator she got into “hot water with this giant group of crypto voters in a very tight election year.”\n\nHowever, Novogratz did note that the Democratic Party is not a monolith, and that many have been calling for positive regulation and consumer protections, including New York Representative Ritchie Torres and Democratic Leader of the House Hakeem Jeffries, who “got it.”\n\nEchoing Rep. Tom Emmer (R–MN.), who said yesterday that while Congress appears increasingly willing to pass crypto legislation the Senate remains a potential roadblock, Novogratz said that the most important politician in office right now is Debbie Stabenow (D–MI), who chairs the agriculture committee and serves on the finance and budget committees, who may determine when votes are held.\n\nPart of what is driving these recent political changes is the sheer amount of money entering campaigns and all but ensuring crypto becomes an election issue. Novogratz estimated that upwards of $150 million has already been directed to crypto-focused Super PACs, which have become “de facto” Republican.\n\nSee also: The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis)\n\nThe wonderful thing about any decentralized movement is it takes an army\" to take on,” Novogratz said, highlighting the number of high profile people like Coinbase founder Brian Armstrong “constantly pushing” for reforms. “There are tons of people who run companies and have vested interests” that have moved the needle. “I like to think Galaxy is part of that, but by no means can we take a lot of credit.”\n\nSo, assuming a re-empowered crypto industry becomes a bone fide political force, what can the world expect to happen?\n\nWell, assuming Biden reneges on his decision to veto Congress’ decision to repeal the Security and Exchange Commission’s SAB121 accounting rule, that would mean a number of TradFi custodians like State Street and the Bank of New York could start custodying crypto. And they will, Novogratz said.\n\n“You will see a stampede of firms like Citi and Jeffries entering into this space. I\u0027m hoping in some ways it’s delayed a little so guys like us can build our muscles stronger,” he added. Though baby boomers, which Novogratz called the wealthiest age group in the history of the planet with $45 trillion in assets, may not be immediately convinced on the merits of crypto. “That’s a 10-year conversation.”\n\nBut because the “government can’t stop spending money on the left and on the right,” the narrative of crypto will continue to take hold. “Donald Trump and Joe Biden normalized … profligate fiscal policies,” he said.\n\nRelatedly, if crypto’s political influence continues to grow it will likely be able to exert pressure to change unfavorable rules. This might be the case for ETH ETFs, which at launch will likely not be able to stake the underlying asset in the funds. He estimates that if enough people gain exposure to ETH, within 12 to 24 months of launch, “they will change the rules to allow staking.”\n\n“You\u0027d rather get a yield than not get yield,” he said.\n\nThen there is the matter of the plethora of open and expected SEC lawsuits. Novogratz expects that many of these cases will be thrown out due to a confluence of factors, including the nearing end of Gensler’s term, the regulatory uncertainty around market structure (i.e. whether tokens are securities or commodities) and fears of administrative overreach.\n\nSee also: Why the SEC Shouldn\u0027t Classify ETH as a Security\n\n“Common sense will take over,” he said. “It really does feel like the assault on crypto companies over the last three years was one of the most un-American things I\u0027ve seen. It was politically motivated, in my mind, and I don\u0027t think it was good for the country. And I think most civil servants and politicians believe that, too.”\n\nFinally, there are practical considerations for Galaxy, which is a publicly traded company in Canada that is looking to list in the U.S. Novogratz explained that the firm failed to file its paperwork while Trump was in office, and has been trying “to go public literally since the very beginning of the against Gensler-Biden SEC.”\n\nExplaining the “long and arduous process,” which has cost the firm an estimated $25 million, feels like it is accelerating (and that it was never clear why so many firms were being “slow rolled), Novogratz gave a cautiously optimistic estimate that by early next year Galaxy might enter the U.S. as a public company.\n\n“It\u0027s been a complete and total disadvantage not having access to the world\u0027s greatest capital markets,” he said. With any luck, the political headwinds for crypto firms have come to an end.\n\nCORRECTION (JUN. 3, 2024): Tom Emmer is a member of the House of Representatives, not a Senator.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Piracy could cost the television and movie industries $52 billion by 2022, but blockchain technology could potentially play a role to control that.\n\nDigital piracy costs the U.S. economy an estimated loss of domestic revenues of at least $29.2 billion each year, along with an estimated reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) between $47.5 billion and $115.3 billion. Using blockchain technology could be one strategy to help in the effort to halt digital piracy. In theory, a blockchain Internet and distributed ledger technology (DLT) could help prevent pirates from hiding their unlawful piracy activities online. Companies are already using blockchain to prevent piracy through content surveillance and digital watermarking.\n\nThe estimated number of viewings of U.S.-produced movies that are pirated digitally each year.\n\n",
    "content": "In a study produced by the Global Innovation Policy Center for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, global online piracy costs the U.S. economy at least $29.2 billion and as much as $71 billion in lost domestic revenues each year.\n\nWhile this figure is significant, it doesn\u0027t take into account the annual losses to the U.S. economy in jobs and in the reduced gross domestic product (GDP). The report estimates digital video piracy results in between $47.5 billion and $115.3 billion in reduced U.S. GDP per year along with losses of between 230,000 and 560,000 jobs.﻿﻿To be sure, media companies have taken steps to protect their content from piracy, but this has not been enough to fully cut off the process. Now, analysts have speculated that blockchain technology could potentially play a role in the control of this content and the protection against piracy going forward.\n\nBlockchain as a Player in the Fight\n\nWhile blockchain is unlikely to be able to address piracy fully on its own, blockchain technology could be best put toward this cause as one component of a larger effort to stop piracy.\n\nPart of the reason for this is that there are many potential reasons why piracy takes place, and experts have yet to arrive at a definitive explanation for the practice. Various factors like cultural norms, lack of access, unaffordability, and even a general view of media content as not having inherent value can all contribute to piracy activities.\n\nIn theory, if the Internet were built on blockchain technology, it could become impossible or, at the very least, extremely difficult for pirates to unlawfully share and profit from media content. The reason for this, presumably, is that a blockchain Internet would allow for the tracking of unlawful actions via distributed ledger technology (DLT). Individuals would not be able to hide their piracy activities as they can now. However, a blockchain Internet remains speculative.\n\nContent Surveillance\n\nOne way that blockchain can help to prevent piracy at this stage is through content surveillance. Vevue is a blockchain streaming service developing a technology to track the life cycle of media content. Founder Thomas Olson has indicated that \"if someone copies content tracked by our technology by any possible means, including videoing or recording a screen, our platform will be able to identify the owner of the device/system where the content was last played.\"﻿﻿In this case, blockchain itself does not track the content; this is dependent upon a unique computational process inherent in Vevue\u0027s project. However, blockchain would allow the surveillance data to be stored and shared efficiently. Put another way, blockchain is a record that Vevue\u0027s team can use to assist in the tracking actions of its proprietary technology.\n\nBounty Hunting\n\nBlockchain can also help with the process of digital watermarking, a process akin to bounty hunting. South African company CustosTech has used the bitcoin (BTC) blockchain to build a proprietary digital watermarking technology. This technology allows the embedding of a monetary reward, like BTC tokens, in media files. These watermarks are embedded in such a way as to be imperceptible to the content receiver and impossible to remove. If a file is pirated, CustosTech can analyze the watermark for that file to determine who the legal recipient of the file was.\n\nThe fact that a monetary reward can be encoded in the process as well could serve as an incentive for those outside of the media space to help find pirated files. Indeed, CustosTech\u0027s bounty-hunting program is available to anyone. By helping to track down pirated files, hunters can earn rewards in BTC.\n\nThe idea of rewarding users with cryptocurrency for their assistance in fighting piracy translates to the project of Rawg, a cross-device game discovery platform, as well. This company is aiming to create a blockchain system that rewards video gamers with cryptocurrency tokens for achievements they earn in the game itself. Gamers are only able to synchronize their achievements for token rewards with non-pirated games and on official platforms. In this sense, Rawg is not offering a bounty-hunting reward but rather an incentive for gamers to avoid piracy on their own.\n\nMany other projects are exploring the anti-piracy space and using blockchain technology. Are they likely to fully eradicate the practice? No, but they very well may help to reduce the amount of revenue lost as a result.\n\n",

    "summary": "The Bitcoin price has quickly recovered from its recent dip to a six-month low of $53,500 on July 5th, reclaiming the coveted $66,000 level.\n\n",
    "content": "The Bitcoin price has quickly recovered from its recent dip to a six-month low of $53,500 on July 5th, reclaiming the $66,000 level and setting its sights on retesting its all-time high of $73,700 reached in March. This resurgence comes as major airlines, medical facilities, corporations, and police forces worldwide grapple with a massive information technology (IT) disruption affecting Microsoft’s cloud computing services.\n\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike shed light on the cause of the outages, attributing them to a “routine software update” that went wrong. To reassure the public, CrowdStrike emphasized that the incident was not a security breach or cyberattack.\n\nThe company then quickly issued a new software update that automatically repaired some affected computers. However, some systems required manual reboots and patching, resulting in significant delays.\n\nMicrosoft, on its part, announced the recovery of its 365 apps and services late Friday morning, though some individual customers may still experience residual impact.\n\nInterestingly, amid the chaos caused by the IT outage, cryptocurrency prices remained unaffected, capturing the attention of US Senator Cynthia Lummis.\n\nKnown for her pro-crypto and Bitcoin stance, Senator Lummis took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to highlight the resilience of the Bitcoin price amid widespread cyber outages, stating: “Do you know what form of currency hasn’t been affected by widespread cyber outages? Bitcoin. Vires in Numeris.”\n\nMeanwhile, speculation surrounding Bitcoin’s potential as a strategic reserve asset for the United States has been intensifying.\n\nAnticipation has been further fueled by the upcoming appearance of former US President Donald Trump in Nashville on July 27, who some predict will announce the largest cryptocurrency on the market as a key to the US economy, potentially providing a massive boost to the Bitcoin price.\n\nAs the Bitcoin price continues its recovery, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has detected a significant development on the Bitcoin daily chart as the TD Sequential indicator has generated a sell signal.\n\nHowever, the analyst noted that the signal can be invalidated if Bitcoin manages to close above the crucial threshold of $67,500. The cryptocurrency’s current price stands at $66,666, reflecting a 5% increase within the past 24 hours and an impressive surge of over 16% in the past week alone.\n\nSustaining a close above the level identified by Martinez becomes paramount to avoid a potential correction on its path towards the highly anticipated $70,000 milestone.\n\nWhile Bitcoin’s upward trajectory is strong, it may encounter resistance at various price levels before reaching its target noted by bearish thresholds at $67,600, $68,380, and $69,700, which could pose challenges to Bitcoin’s price rise.\n\nConversely, Bitcoin can find support from its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently positioned at $62,600, which represents a long-term trend indicator, often regarded as a robust support level.\n\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com\n\n",

    "content": "In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency, investors are constantly on the lookout for tokens that offer not just financial gains but also utility and enjoyment. Two tokens that have recently captured the spotlight are Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). While Solana continues to build on its robust blockchain infrastructure, Mpeppe is making waves with its unique approach to combining utility and fun. This article delves into why these two tokens are garnering attention and why now might be the perfect time to invest in them.\n\nSolana (SOL) has positioned itself as one of the most formidable competitors to Ethereum. With its lower valuation compared to Ethereum, Solana (SOL) offers significant growth potential. Recently, Solana’s ecosystem has seen remarkable development, outpacing Ethereum in several key metrics. For instance, Solana achieved a daily revenue of $1.07 million, surpassing Ethereum’s $0.55 million. This indicates a growing preference for Solana among users and developers.\n\nHowever, it’s not just the daily figures that are impressive. Over a seven-day period, Ethereum still leads with $9.35 million in revenue compared to Solana’s $6.35 million. Similarly, in the past month, Ethereum generated $52.34 million, more than double Solana’s $23.24 million. Despite these numbers, Solana’s consistent performance and growth indicate its potential to challenge Ethereum’s dominance in the long run.\n\nOne of the key strengths of Solana (SOL) lies in its decentralized applications (Dapps). Solana-Dapps have recently taken the lead in generating fees. For instance, Jito’s liquid staking on Solana (SOL) brought in $3.27 million in fees within 24 hours, surpassing Ethereum’s Lido, which earned $2.94 million. Other Solana Dapps like Raydium and Solana (SOL) itself also performed exceptionally well, with $2.49 million and $2.13 million in fees, respectively, outpacing Ethereum’s $1.58 million.\n\nDespite these impressive short-term figures, Ethereum remains the leader in fee generation over longer periods. In the past seven days, Lido and Ethereum earned $20.83 million and $17.87 million, respectively, compared to Solana’s $12.69 million. Over 30 days, Ethereum’s fee generation of $87.96 million dwarfed Solana’s $46.47 million. However, the rapid growth of Solana’s Dapps showcases its potential to increase market share and compete more aggressively with Ethereum.\n\nWhile Solana (SOL) continues to thrive on its technical merits, Mpeppe (MPEPE) brings a fresh perspective to the meme coin space. Currently in Stage 2 of its presale, Mpeppe is trading at $0.00107 USDT, with nearly 60% of the tokens already sold. This rapid uptake reflects growing investor confidence and excitement about Mpeppe’s potential.\n\nMpeppe (MPEPE) stands out by integrating utility with its meme coin status. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, Mpeppe offers real-world applications through decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming platforms. This approach not only provides entertainment but also tangible value to its users, making it a unique and attractive investment.\n\nInvestors are particularly drawn to Mpeppe (MPEPE) for its high return potential. Analysts predict that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could achieve up to 600% gains, driven by its innovative approach and strong market positioning. Early investors have the chance to capitalize on its presale phase, where the token is available at a relatively low price.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, tokens like Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer exciting opportunities for investors. Solana’s robust infrastructure and growing Dapp ecosystem make it a strong contender against Ethereum, while Mpeppe’s unique blend of utility and fun sets it apart in the meme coin space. For those looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on emerging trends, both Solana and Mpeppe present compelling cases.\n\nThe smart contract address for Mpeppe (MPEPE) is 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B. As Mpeppe’s presale continues to attract more investors, its future looks promising, offering a fresh and innovative approach to the world of meme coins.\n\n\n\nFor more information on the Mpeppe (MPEPE) Presale:\n\nVisit Mpeppe (MPEPE)\n\nJoin and become a community member:\n\nhttps://t.me/mpeppecoin\n\nhttps://x.com/mpeppecommunity?s\u003d11\u0026t\u003dhQv3guBuxfglZI-0YOTGuQ\n\n",

    "content": "The internet has been moving towards a new era in which users would have more control over their digital experiences. Web3, the new generation of internet, leverages blockchain technology to create a user-centric and decentralized web. Interoperability is one of the crucial concepts that define the potential of web3 for inducing transformative changes. The importance of web3 interoperability becomes clearly evident from the troubles caused due to lack of interoperability in web2.\n\nInteroperability is an essential requirement to ensure that different systems can exchange information with the help of a common framework. Web2 creates limitations for interoperability with isolated databases for each application. Interoperability may change things in web3 by enabling communication between dApps and web3 protocols. Learn more about the significance of interoperability and how it can change user experiences in web3.\n\n\n\nThe first aspect in any guide on interoperability would revolve around its definition. The review of answers to queries like ‘What is interoperability in web3?’ points at the flexibility for communication between different networks. Interoperability is the ability of blockchain networks to exchange information with each other. It helps in shattering the conventional precedents that involve blockchain networks working in isolation with their unique collection of smart contracts, rules and protocols.\n\nThe lack of interoperability serves as a barrier for seamless movement of assets and data across different blockchain networks. You would need interoperability in web3 to expand the capabilities of decentralized apps and web3 solutions. The concept of interoperability is similar to using an Amazon gift card to pay for a cup of coffee. Interoperability also serves critical advantages through the flexibility to transfer different types of digital assets between dApps on the same blockchain or between different blockchains.\n\nEnroll now in the Blockchain Scalability and Interoperability Mastery Course to learn the skills needed to develop faster, scalable, robust, and interoperable dApps.\n\nInteroperability is one of the crucial factors that improves the utility and value of digital assets in web3. You can notice the best interoperability in web3 example in the domain of DeFi. Interoperability in DeFi can help in staking tokens, using them as collateral and exchanging them for other digital assets.\n\nYou can think of an interoperability example in a scenario where Starbucks and Spotify can enter into a partnership. Imagine that you can use the reward tokens of Starbucks to unlock special playlists on Spotify. In addition, interoperability between the NFT programs of these two brands can improve the NFTs of both brands with cross-platform utility.\n\nThe concept of interoperability in web3 appears promising with its different advantages. Seamless communication and asset exchange between blockchain protocols, dApps and web3 solutions can open the doors for new opportunities. However, interoperability is still a distant reality for web3 owing to diverse challenges. A review of the prominent challenges for interoperability can help you find the ideal direction towards achieving true interoperability.\n\nScalability would emerge as a formidable concern in the domain of web3 as blockchain networks gain more users. The introduction of more blockchain networks would also create scalability issues. The growth in transaction volumes alongside increasing congestion of networks can interrupt the seamless transfer of data and assets between blockchain networks.\n\nWeb3 projects might hesitate to make the move for achieving interoperability. The lack of clarity regarding incentives can create limitations for adopting interoperability standards. Therefore, it is important to establish frameworks that can offer the ideal rewards for data sharing and collaboration between blockchains. Rewards are more likely to encourage the rise of interoperable solutions in web3.\n\nThe next prominent challenge for web3 interoperability is the lack of standardization in the protocols in blockchain networks. Therefore, web3 solutions do not have a universal communication language. Blockchain networks have their unique features, smart contract languages and consensus mechanisms that create barriers for interoperability.\n\nInteroperability is responsible for introducing many new challenges for web3 security. The vulnerabilities or breaches in one blockchain could have a significant influence on the connected networks. The adoption of interoperability would depend on addressing the security and integrity of cross-chain transactions.\n\n\n\nThe reasons to introduce interoperability provide motivation to overcome different challenges. You can identify the necessity of interoperability in web3 in the highly fragmented nature of the blockchain ecosystem. Different blockchains have their unique advantages and features tailored for distinctive purposes. However, the fragmentation in the blockchain landscape creates silos and leads to different challenges.\n\nThe lack of interoperability restricts the functionalities of dApps to the blockchain they use. It is difficult to transfer the assets on one blockchain to another network. Most important of all, the lack of interoperability also has a negative impact on user experiences. Users have to navigate multiple interfaces, wallets and exchanges in the existing web3 landscape thereby creating complexities for users.\n\nYou can find different examples to understand the importance of interoperability for growth of web3. The utility of NFTs is limited as they can work only on specific blockchain networks and platforms. Interoperability can help NFTs access broader markets and new utilities. Interoperability can also help DeFi solutions by improving liquidity and offers a strong foundation for creating new DeFi apps.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nThe importance of interoperability for the web3 ecosystem becomes clearly evident in the changes it can introduce for users and developers. It is also important to learn about the most effective solutions for achieving interoperability. Let us find out some of the most effective solutions to improve interoperability in different web3 solutions.\n\nThe first solution that comes to mind when you think of the concept of interoperability in web3 is a cross-chain bridge. Cross-chain bridges serve as connectors between different blockchain networks for transferring data and assets. The bridges can leverage different mechanisms like hashed time-locked contracts to achieve verifiable and secure transactions across blockchains.\n\nWeb3 projects can adopt interoperability when they have the assurance of unique incentive mechanisms. The most effective incentive mechanisms to achieve web3 interoperability include liquidity provision, staking rewards and token swaps. The incentives can help in developing symbiotic relationships between the interconnected networks.\n\nSidechains are another prominent example of interoperability solutions for web3. They are unique secondary blockchain networks that offer the security of the primary blockchain alongside improving interoperability and scalability. Layer 2 scaling solutions can address the concerns of scalability that might hinder the adoption of interoperability.\n\nAtomic swaps are another effective addition to an interoperability in web3 example list for their unique functionality. They ensure direct exchange of assets between blockchains without involving intermediaries. The trustless mechanism in atomic swaps eliminates counterparty risks.\n\nDecentralized oracles might also serve as formidable catalysts for the growth of interoperability in the web3 ecosystem. Oracles are third-party services that collect data from external sources and verify the data for integrity and correctness. Web3 solutions can leverage oracles for seamless communication with different blockchain networks.\n\nInteroperability protocols are effective solutions for development of standardized protocols. The standardized protocols can ensure seamless communication between blockchains thereby offering the assurance of interoperability. Interoperability protocols work by defining a common collection of rules for executing smart contracts and ensuring effective data exchange.\n\nCurious to develop an in-depth understanding of web3 application architecture? Enroll now in the Web3 Application Development Course\n\nThe evolution of the blockchain space indicates promising opportunities for the growth of web3. The responses to queries like “What is interoperability in web3?” help you understand how interoperability would play a major role in determining the future of decentralized web. It is important to observe the most impactful developments for achieving interoperability that would determine the future of interoperability.\n\nMulti-chain platforms have emerged as the most effective examples of interoperability. Some of the popular choices such as Avalanche, Polkadot and Cosmos have been successfully addressing interoperability challenges.

    "summary": "Data suggests there may be minimal resistance ahead for Bitcoin, something that could facilitate a rally towards a new ATH for the asset.\n\n",
    "content": "On-chain data suggests minimal resistance for Bitcoin, which could facilitate a rally toward a new all-time high (ATH).\n\nAccording to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, resistance looks light in the price ranges ahead. In on-chain analysis, the strength of support and resistance levels is based on the number of investors who last bought their coins at them.\n\nThe chart below shows what the cost basis distribution on the Bitcoin network looked like at the time of the analytics firm’s post.\n\nIn the graph, the size of the dot corresponds to the addresses that purchased their coins inside the corresponding range. As is apparent, when IntoTheBlock shared the data, the price ranges ahead all had small dots, while those below had big ones.\n\nThis suggested that few investors left in the market had their cost basis higher than the spot price. That is, there weren’t many holders in loss left anymore.\n\nSince then, however, BTC has seen some pullback into the first of the big circles. Nonetheless, at the current price, most holders should still be in the green.\n\nTo any investor, their cost basis is naturally an important level, and they may be more likely to make a move when a retest of it happens. Investors in loss may look forward to such a retest to exit at their break-even to escape away with their initial investment.\n\nA few investors selling at their break-even isn’t of any consequence to the entire market, but if a large amount of them share their cost basis inside a narrow range, then perhaps a reaction large enough to cause fluctuations in the price can emerge.\n\nThis is why the strength of support and resistance price levels is related to the number of investors who have their cost basis in on-chain analysis.\n\nAs investors in loss may react to a retest of their cost basis by selling, large red dots can be potential sources of resistance. However, BTC has no significant obstacles left, so the price could be set to travel to higher levels.\n\nAs investors in loss react by selling, those in profit can look at the retest of their acquisition level as an opportunity to buy more instead. Thus, green dots can be support centers for the cryptocurrency. As BTC has fallen to one of these green dots, it’s possible the coin can use the cushion to spear ahead at the relatively light red ranges.\n\nSomething to keep in mind, however, is that while there may not be many investors desperate to exit at their break-even, there is also a different obstacle BTC could face: profit-taking.\n\nWith an extreme majority of investors in profits, many would likely become tempted to harvest some of their gains as the coin surges toward a new ATH. It remains to be seen whether demand would be able to absorb this potential selloff.\n\nBitcoin had neared the $70,000 level earlier in the day, but the coin has since plunged towards the $67,800 mark.\n\n",

    "content": "As a growing number of businesses and developers embrace blockchain technology, technology leaders are offering new tools allowing the blockchain technology to be used simply and efficiently. (See also, Can Decentralized, Blockchain-based Internet Become A Reality?)Azure Blockchain Workbench - A Tool to Rapid Blockchain Development\n\nIndustry leader Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) yesterday announced the Azure Blockchain Workbench, a new set of tools for developers who work with distributed ledger technology. The announcement was accompanied by a public preview release of Azure Blockchain Workbench that was made during the 3-day annual Microsoft Build conference which is taking place from May 7 to May 9 2018 in Seattle.\n\nAzure Marketplace is a one-stop shop for all software requirements that are certified and optimized to run on Azure. It allows a user to search and procure a variety of software solutions ranging from open source container platforms to threat detection to blockchain-based apps and services. Developers and businesses are also allowed to sell their developed apps and software products on the marketplace. The platform also supports consulting services, like the implementation of database services or proof of concepts.\n\nMicrosoft said Workbench is \"the scaffolding for an end-to-end blockchain application\" which can be easily built \"with just a few simple clicks,\" a new platform that will allow the development of blockchain applications within days compared to months.\n\nThe Million-Dollar Blockchain Implementation Opportunity\n\nAs businesses witness an increased use of blockchain-based solutions, Microsoft is attempting to capitalize on the opportunity by offering a ready-to-use infrastructure to be instantly available to customers looking for the quick implementation of blockchain solutions.\n\n“Workbench gets customers started quickly by automating infrastructure setup, so developers can focus on application logic, and business owners can focus on defining and validating their use cases,” Matthew Kerner, general manager, Microsoft Azure, said in the announcement.\n\nThe workbench automates the necessary deployment of distributed ledgers and network construction, saving developers from infrastructure and maintenance related overhead. The integration between the blockchain and Azure services is also taken care of by Workbench.\n\nThough Workbench was announced yesterday, it was already made available to select parties earlier. Since September, Azure has offered the Workbench for a few early adopters. For instance, the Israeli Bank Hapoalim used it to configure a solution which allowed it to process bank guarantees for large purchases more quickly and easily. Global food giant Nestle tested it to track the supply chain of its Bacio Perugina chocolate in Italy. In the U.S., Apttus is using the platform to build and deploy smart contracts to secure, track and adjust to changes in loans that are securitized and pooled for collateralized debt instruments.\n\nThis offering is similar to Hyperledger Cello, which operates as “Blockchain as a Service (BaaS)”, a service-based blockchain implementation that allows users to forget about maintaining blockchain network and infrastructure.

    "content": "The approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2023 has opened the floodgates for significant institutional investment in the newly approved market. However, US states are also rushing to capitalize on the success of these ETFs by allocating a portion of their pension funds to reap profits and diversify their investments.\n\nThe first state to take the plunge was Wisconsin, which in May 2023 allocated approximately $98.6 million, or 2% of its pension fund, to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF.\n\nNow, two more states have joined Wisconsin in allocating state pension funds to Bitcoin ETFs. On Thursday, NewsBTC reported that the mayor of Jersey City, Steven Fulop, announced that it is updating its paperwork with the SEC to allow its pension fund to invest in Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe latest state to join the Bitcoin ETF investment bandwagon is Michigan; as in an SEC filing on Friday morning, the State of Michigan Retirement System reported owning $6.6 million worth of shares in the ARK Bitcoin ETF managed by Ark Invest, amounting to 110,000 shares as of June 30th.\n\nHowever, Jersey City remains the only one that discloses the percentage of the fund’s investment in the Bitcoin ETF market and which asset manager will be selected to manage the fund’s allocation.\n\nStill, this notes the significant traction that the new Bitcoin ETF market has gained over the past seven months among institutions and now these states, adding to the notable inflows and assets under management surpassing the $17 billion milestone, eclipsing tech-based ETFs.\n\nThe Bitcoin price has steadily recovered over the past two weeks, rebounding from a 6-month low of $53,500 at the beginning of July. However, according to a new report by on-chain and market data analytics firm CryptoQuant, this price recovery has continued to rely on spot Bitcoin ETFs rather than a surge of new investor inflows.\n\nThe CryptoQuant report examined Bitcoin price movements and new investor holdings over the past 8 years and found that in previous long-term bull cycles, the Bitcoin price peaked when the number of new entrants crossed a certain threshold, indicating a strong “fear of missing out” (FOMO) driving inflows.\n\nHowever, the firm contends that the current Bitcoin bull cycle does not exhibit the same trend of new investor inflows at price tops. Instead, the report noted that the recent spike in new inflows seen in the year’s first quarter appears to be just a temporary wave between longer-term cycle tops.\n\nThis suggests that Bitcoin’s recent price recovery has been driven more by the inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs rather than a surge of new investors entering the crypto market.\n\nWhile spot ETFs have supported the Bitcoin price, the report indicates that a more sustainable upside will depend on a return of new investor demand.\n\nWhen writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market was trading at $67,530, up nearly 5% in the 24-hour time frame.\n\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com\n\n",

CoinDesk has compiled a timeline to help you piece together the picture.\n\nZac Prince and Flori Marquez founded BlockFi in October 2017 with a lofty mission: provide credit services to the cryptocurrency market. Prince, the CEO, had worked in sales before founding BlockFi. Marquez, the company’s chief operating officer, managed financial portfolios for Bond Street, a small-time lender that Goldman Sachs acquired in 2017, before founding BlockFi. The firm set up shop in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in subsequent years expanded to New York, Singapore, Poland and Argentina. In January 2018, BlockFi launched its first offering: loans of U.S. dollars backed by cryptocurrencies. Simply, clients could deposit bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) and take out loans in fiat against that crypto collateral.\n\nVenture capital money followed swiftly. In February 2018, BlockFi raised $1.55 million in a seed round led by ConsenSys Ventures. In July 2018, it raised a hefty $52.5 million in a funding round led by Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital. And at the end of 2018, BlockFi raised another $4 million by issuing convertible notes, with Akuna Capital the main buyer.\n\nFlush with cash, the startup got to work. In March 2019 it launched a crypto deposit account that would reinvest earnings from bitcoin or ether deposits and provide an opportunity to earn compound interest at a 6.2% annual percentage yield (APY). BlockFi adjusted these rates over time; oin May 2019 it almost halved the interest rate on ETH deposits. The risk of the high-interest account, as explained to CoinDesk, was that it \"doesn’t come with the backing of the federal government like a savings account at a bank does.” As the market heated up over the next few years and BlockFi continued to grow, that didn’t seem to hold people back from depositing their money with the company.\n\nThe firm’s next huge cash injection came in August 2019, when BlockFi raised $18.3 million in a Series A funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures. They were joined by Winklevoss Capital, Galaxy Digital, ConsenSys, Akuna Capital and others. Earlier that year, BlockFi reached a milestone of having over $50 million deposited in its interest-bearing accounts.\n\nIn December 2019, BlockFi got into the crypto trading game, offering an unusual model that charged zero fees on purchases and sales. Instead of charging trading fees, BlockFi profited by selling trading data to institutional crypto firms that, in turn, provided liquidity to BlockFi, similar to Robinhood’s business model. “Market makers want the information about what trades are happening, and they get it by having relationships with as many venues as they can support to receive that order flow,” BlockFi’s CEO said.\n\nPeter Thiel’s Valar Ventures led BlockFi’s $30 million Series B funding round in February 2020, with repeat investors including Akuna Capital and new investors including HashKey Capital, which CEO Prince noted as key to helping “BlockFi expand into Singapore” and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nBlockFi partnered with Silvergate Bank to allow customers to utilize cash deposits via wire transfer to buy bitcoin. Prior to the move, BlockFi was limited to “crypto payment rails” such as stablecoins. Prince said he had been inundated by “requests every day from our existing clients, and also from folks who aren\u0027t already cryptocurrency owners.” The company disclosed the previous month it had $650 million of assets on its platform.\n\nAll was going well. Then: a hack! In 2020, a single attacker targeted an employee’s phone with a “SIM swap” that tricked the mobile carrier into activating the employee’s phone on another device. This allowed the hacker to gain access to some of BlockFi’s retail marketing systems. No funds were lost, but the attacker managed to access confidential information about BlockFi’s customers.\n\nIn August 2020, BlockFi raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Morgan Creek Digital. At the time, Zac Prince said the lender held $1.5 billion in assets and made a little under $10 million in revenue each month. National Basketball Association star Matthew Dellavedova was among the investors.\n\nIn October 2020, BlockFi invested big into Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk\u0027s parent, Digital Currency Group), taking a 5% stake of the $4.8 billion fund. The other big whale invested in GBTC at the time? Hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which had a 6% stake as of June 2020.\n\nBlockFi continued to expand its stake in GBTC, to $1.7 billion in GBTC by February 2021. Unfortunately, it later turned out that it was difficult to get money out of GBTC. In addition, as of writing, shares in the trust trade at a huge discount to bitcoin.\n\nEarly in 2021, BlockFi registered its own Bitcoin Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, putting it in direct competition with Grayscale’s product. The fund offered a lower management fee and partnered with Fidelity Digital Asset Services to custody the assets. In November of that same year, it filed for approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nAll was going well for BlockFi. With bitcoin’s soaring price hitting all-time highs (bitcoin crossed the $60,000 mark for the first time in March 2021), BlockFi raised $350 million, giving the company a valuation of $3 billion. It held $15 billion in assets and aimed to increase its staff to 500 people by the end of the year. It said it had 225,000 users, up from 10,000 in late 2019. What could go wrong?\n\nNew Jersey’s Bureau of Securities was the first to deliver a big blow. The state’s financial regulator claimed BlockFi’s interest accounts amounted to sales of an “unregistered security” and issued a ban on creating new interest-bearing accounts. Alabama issued its own notice to the lender shortly after, and Texas joined on the same day. Two days later, Vermont lodged its complaint, and at the end of the month Kentucky ordered the lender to stop signing up new interest account customers.\n\nThe CEO called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to look into the matter. So the national securities regulator did exactly that – and it didn’t end well for BlockFi (we’ll get to that next). It was poor timing for BlockFi, which was looking to raise $500 million in a Series E and was launching a Visa rewards credit card.\n\nIn February, BlockFi settled with the SEC for $100 million over its high-yield lending product. It registered with the SEC, but from mid-February stopped offering the interest account to new clients in the U.S., and prevented existing U.S. clients from adding more money to their accounts. “Today’s settlement makes clear that crypto markets must comply with time-tested securities laws,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.\n\nIn June, BlockFi’s valuation sank to $1 billion in a “down round” – a third of its $3 billion valuation the previous March, when it raised $350 million. At the end of June, the lender held $1.8 billion in open loans and $600 million of exposure. In particular, BlockFi had made huge loans to the huge crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which officially filed for bankruptcy protection on July 1. Three Arrows had failed after being overexposed to the collapsed stablecoin ecosystem, Terra; BlockFi, according to reports, had liquidated the hedge fund\u0027s collateral before its bankruptcy. In the same month, bitcoin fell below $20,000. A month later, BlockFi’s main rivals, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network, also filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\nIn dire straits, BlockFi received a $400 million line of credit from crypto exchange FTX later that summer. The exchange also won the right for its U.S. unit to buy BlockFi FTX US almost bought the lender for just $25 million, and in August could have bought the company for as little as $15 million if certain key terms weren’t met, such as receiving SEC clearance to operate its yield-generating services in the U.S.\n\nAt the start of the month, FTX itself collapsed after CoinDesk published a story based on private financial documents on Nov. 2 that poked holes in the balance sheet of FTX sister company, trading firm Alameda Research. It took only nine more days for FTX to completely melt down, and it went to bankruptcy court on Nov. 11.\n\nThat was bad for BlockFi, which needed FTX’s credit facility to remain afloat. Late on Nov. 10, BlockFi paused customer withdrawals amid “the lack of clarity” about FTX. On Nov. 11, California’s financial regulator revoked BlockFi’s lending license.\n\nBlockFi started preparing for its bankruptcy filing shortly after that. On Nov. 28, it officially filed for protection under Chapter 11, leaving over 100,000 creditors in the lurch. Filings later revealed that Alameda had defaulted on $680 million worth of loans to BlockFi. After filing in the bankruptcy court, BlockFi sued Sam Bankman-Fried\u0027s Emergent Fidelity Technologies for its Robinhood shares, which were pledged to BlockFi as collateral for a loan.\n\nIn the first bankruptcy hearing, lawyers for BlockFi said the lender held $355 million in crypto on FTX. All the while, one question looms: Will customers get anything back?\n\nRead More: Latest BlockFi Stories\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A blockchain is a digitally distributed, decentralized, public ledger that exists across a network. It is most noteworthy in its use with cryptocurrencies and NFTs.\n\nBlockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks linked together via cryptography. Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use for transactions has been as a ledger. In Bitcoin’s case, the blockchain is decentralized, so no single person or group has control—instead, all users collectively retain control. Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.\n\nGenerating these hashes until a specific value is found is the \"proof-of-work\" you hear so much about—it \"proves\" the miner did the work. The amount of work it takes to validate the hash is why the Bitcoin network consumes so much computational power and energy.\n\nNot all blockchains are 100% impenetrable. They are distributed ledgers that use code to create the security level they have become known for. If there are vulnerabilities in the coding, they can be exploited.\n\nIllicit activity accounted for only 0.34% of all cryptocurrency transactions in 2023.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Blockchain?\n\nA blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared among a computer network\u0027s nodes. They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutable—the term used to describe the inability to be altered.\n\nBecause there is no way to change a block, the only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data. This aspect reduces the need for trusted third parties, which are usually auditors or other humans that add costs and make mistakes.\n\nSince Bitcoin\u0027s introduction in 2009, blockchain uses have exploded via the creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts.\n\nHow Does a Blockchain Work?\n\nYou might be familiar with spreadsheets or databases. A blockchain is somewhat similar because it is a database where information is entered and stored. But the key difference between a traditional database or spreadsheet and a blockchain is how the data is structured and accessed.\n\nA blockchain consists of programs called scripts that conduct the tasks you usually would in a database: Entering and accessing information and saving and storing it somewhere. A blockchain is distributed, which means multiple copies are saved on many machines, and they must all match for it to be valid.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain collects transaction information and enters it into a 4MB file called a block (other blockchains use different size blocks). Once it is full, certain information is run through an encryption algorithm, which creates a hexadecimal number called the block header hash.\n\nThe hash is then entered into the following block header and encrypted with the other information in that block\u0027s header, creating a chain of blocks.\n\nTransactions follow a specific process, depending on the blockchain they are taking place on. For example, on Bitcoin\u0027s blockchain, if you initiate a transaction using your cryptocurrency wallet—the application that provides an interface for the blockchain—it starts a sequence of events.\n\nIn Bitcoin, your transaction is sent to a memory pool, where it is stored and queued until a miner picks it up. Once it is entered into a block and the block fills up with transactions, it is closed, and the mining begins.\n\nEvery node in the network proposes its own blocks in this way because they all choose different transactions. Each works on their own blocks, trying to find a solution to the difficulty target, using the \"nonce,\" short for number used once.\n\nThe nonce value is a field in the block header that is changeable, and its value incrementally increases every attempt. Every miner starts with a nonce of zero. If the resulting hash isn\u0027t equal to or less than the target hash, a value of one is added to the nonce, a new hash is generated, and so on. The nonce rolls over about every 4.5 billion attempts (which takes less than one second) and uses another value called the extra nonce as an additional counter. This continues until a miner generates a valid hash, winning the race and receiving the reward.\n\nOnce a block is closed, a transaction is complete. However, the block is not considered to be confirmed until five other blocks have been validated. Confirmation takes the network about one hour to complete because it averages just under 10 minutes per block (the first block with your transaction and five following blocks multiplied by 10 equals 60 minutes).\n\nNot all blockchains follow this process. For instance, the Ethereum network randomly chooses one validator from all users with ether staked to validate blocks, which are then confirmed by the network. This is much faster and less energy intensive than Bitcoin\u0027s process.\n\nBlockchain Decentralization\n\nA blockchain allows the data in a database to be spread out among several network nodes—computers or devices running software for the blockchain—at various locations. This not only creates redundancy but maintains the fidelity of the data. For example, if someone tries to alter a record at one instance of the database, the other nodes would prevent it from happening because they compare block hashes. This way, no single node within the network can alter information within the chain.\n\nBecause of this distribution—and the encrypted proof that work was done—the information and history (like the transactions in cryptocurrency) are irreversible. Such a record could be a list of transactions (such as with a cryptocurrency), but it is also possible for a non-public blockchain to hold a variety of other information like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company\u0027s inventory. Most blockchains wouldn\u0027t \"store\" these items; they would likely be sent through a hashing algorithm and represented on the blockchain by a token.\n\nBlockchain Transparency\n\nBecause of the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by downloading and inspecting them or by using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could track a bitcoin wherever it goes.\n\nFor example, exchanges have been hacked in the past, resulting in the loss of large amounts of cryptocurrency. While the hackers may have been anonymous—except for their wallet address—the crypto they extracted is easily traceable because the wallet addresses are published on the blockchain.\n\nOf course, the records stored in the Bitcoin blockchain (as well as most others) are encrypted. This means that only the person assigned an address can reveal their identity. As a result, blockchain users can remain anonymous while preserving transparency.\n\nIs Blockchain Secure?\n\nBlockchain technology achieves decentralized security and trust in several ways. To begin with, new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. That is, they are always added to the \"end\" of the blockchain. After a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, previous blocks cannot be changed.\n\nA change in any data changes the hash of the block it was in. Because each block contains the previous block\u0027s hash, a change in one would change the following blocks. The network would generally reject an altered block because the hashes would not match. However, this can be accomplished on smaller blockchain networks.\n\nA new and smaller chain might be susceptible to this kind of attack, but the attacker would need at least half of the computational power of the network (called a 51% attack). On the Bitcoin and other larger blockchains, this is nearly impossible. By the time the hacker takes any action, the network is likely to have moved past the blocks they were trying to alter. This is because the rate at which these networks hash is exceptionally fast—the Bitcoin network hashed at a rate of 566–657 exahashes per second (18 zeros) between May and June 2024.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is not likely to be hacked either—the attackers would need to control more than half of the blockchain\u0027s staked ether. Between April and June 2024, more than 32 million ETH was staked by more than one million validators. An attacker or group would need to own more than half of the validators, about 16.4 million ETH, and be randomly selected to validate blocks enough times to get their blocks implemented.\n\nBitcoin vs. Blockchain\n\nBlockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two researchers who wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. But it wasn’t until almost two decades later, with the launch of Bitcoin in January 2009, that blockchain had its first real-world application.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol is built on a blockchain. In a research paper introducing the digital currency, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, referred to it as “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.”The key thing to understand is that Bitcoin uses blockchain as a means to transparently record a ledger of payments or other transactions between parties.\n\nBlockchain can be used to immutably record any number of data points. This could be in the form of transactions, votes in an election, product inventories, state identifications, deeds to homes, and much more.\n\nCurrently, tens of thousands of projects are looking to implement blockchains in various ways to help society other than just recording transactions—for example, as a way to vote securely in democratic elections.\n\nThe nature of blockchain\u0027s immutability means that fraudulent voting would become far more difficult. For example, a voting system could work such that each country\u0027s citizens would be issued a single cryptocurrency or token.\n\nEach candidate could then be given a specific wallet address, and the voters would send their token or crypto to the address of whichever candidate they wish to vote for. The transparent and traceable nature of blockchain would eliminate the need for human vote counting and the ability of bad actors to tamper with physical ballots.\n\nBlockchain vs. Banks\n\nBlockchains have been heralded as a disruptive force in the finance sector, especially with the functions of payments and banking. However, banks and decentralized blockchains are vastly different.\n\nTo see how a bank differs from blockchain, let’s compare the banking system to Bitcoin’s blockchain implementation.\n\nHow Are Blockchains Used?\n\nAs we now know, blocks on Bitcoin’s blockchain store transactional data. Today, tens of thousands of other cryptocurrency systems are running on a blockchain. But it turns out that blockchain is a reliable way of storing data about other types of transactions.\n\nSome companies experimenting with blockchain include Walmart, Pfizer, AIG, Siemens, and Unilever, among others. For example, IBM has created its Food Trust blockchain to trace the journey that food products take to get to their locations.\n\nWhy do this? The food industry has seen countless outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella, and listeria; in some cases, hazardous materials were accidentally introduced to foods. In the past, it has taken weeks to find the source of these outbreaks or the cause of sickness from what people are eating.\n\nUsing blockchain allows brands to track a food product’s route from its origin, through each stop it makes, to delivery. Not only that, but these companies can also now see everything else it may have come in contact with, allowing the identification of the problem to occur far sooner—potentially saving lives. This is one example of blockchain in practice, but many other forms of blockchain implementation exist.\n\nPerhaps no industry stands to benefit from integrating blockchain into its business operations more than personal banking. Financial institutions only operate during business hours, usually five days a week. That means if you try to deposit a check on Friday at 6 p.m., you will likely have to wait until Monday morning to see that money hit your account.\n\nEven if you make your deposit during business hours, the transaction can still take one to three days to verify due to the sheer volume of transactions that banks need to settle. Blockchain, on the other hand, never sleeps.\n\nBy integrating blockchain into banks, consumers might see their transactions processed in minutes or seconds—the time it takes to add a block to the blockchain, regardless of holidays or the time of day or week. With blockchain, banks also have the opportunity to exchange funds between institutions more quickly and securely. Given the size of the sums involved, even the few days the money is in transit can carry significant costs and risks for banks.\n\nThe settlement and clearing process for stock traders can take up to three days (or longer if trading internationally), meaning that the money and shares are frozen for that period. Blockchain could drastically reduce that time.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain technology will disrupt real estate as well.\n\nBlockchain technology has impacted the real estate industry in a variety of ways, including offering a new means for buyers and sellers to connect with one another. Blockchain could be used to cut intermediaries out of the real estate transaction process, thereby reducing costs. This technology could also help to codify the practice of fractional ownership of real estate.\n\n",
    "content": "Given blockchain’s disruption of financial services and subsequent widespread application across industries, it’s hard to find a segment that has not been influenced by the technology. Cryptocurrencies have made a strong impact on payments, remittances, and foreign exchange. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) have challenged stock investing, startup loans, and venture capital. Even the food supply chain industry has been upended by blockchain.\n\nReal estate hasn’t escaped blockchain disruption either. Previously, transacting high value assets such as real estate exclusively through digital channels has never been the norm. Real estate transactions are often conducted offline involving face-to-face engagements with various entities. Blockchain, however, opened up ways to change this. The introduction of smart contracts in blockchain platforms now allows assets like real estate to be tokenized and be traded like cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.\n\nTrading real estate this way varies. Here are six ways blockchain has changed the real estate game.\n\n1. Platforms and Marketplaces\n\nReal estate technology has traditionally been primarily concerned with listings and with connecting buyers and sellers. However, blockchain introduces new ways to trade real estate and can enable trading platforms and online marketplaces to support real estate transactions more comprehensively. For example, ATLANT has developed a platform that uses blockchain technology to facilitate real estate and rental property transactions. By tokenizing real property, assets can then be traded much like stocks on an exchange and transactions can be done online.\n\nATLANT allows sellers to tokenize assets, essentially handling it like a stock sale, and liquidating that asset through a token sale using the platform. The collected tokens can be exchanged for fiat currency, with buyers owning a percentage stake of the property.\n\n2. No Intermediaries\n\nBrokers, lawyers, and banks have long been part of the real estate ecosystem. However, blockchain may soon usher in a shift in their roles and participation in real estate transactions, according to a report by Deloitte.﻿﻿ New platforms can eventually assume functions such as listings, payments, and legal documentation. Cutting out the intermediaries will result in buyers and sellers getting more out of their money as they save on commissions and fees charged by these intermediaries. This also makes the process much quicker as the back-and-forth between these middlemen gets cut.\n\n3. Liquidity\n\nReal estate has long been considered an illiquid asset since it takes time for sales to conclude. This isn’t the case with cryptocurrencies and tokens since they can, in theory, be readily traded for fiat currencies through exchanges. However, as tokens, real estate can be readily traded. A seller doesn’t have to wait for a buyer who can afford the whole property in order to get some value out of their property.\n\n4. Fractional Ownership\n\nBy allowing fractional ownership, blockchain also lowers the barriers to real estate investing. Typically, investments would require significant money upfront in order to acquire property. Alternatively, investors with could also pool their money to acquire bigger ticket properties. Through blockchain, investors would simply have to access a trading app to buy and sell even fractions of tokens as they see fit. In addition, fractional ownership would also help them avoid managing the properties themselves such as maintenance and leasing.\n\nUpkeep alone can add up to significant costs and dealing with tenants may be a troublesome effort. This also affects related activities such as lending where property owners often have to put their properties as collateral for loans in order to get quick access to cash. Depending on the terms, property owners may also continue enjoying use of their property.\n\n5. Decentralization\n\nBlockchain commands trust and security as a decentralized technology. Information stored in the blockchain is accessible to all peers on the network, making data transparent and immutable. One only has to go back to the housing bubble crash in 2008 to see how greed and the lack of transparency in the part of institutions can have catastrophic consequences. A decentralized exchange has trust built into the system. Since information can be verifiable to peers, buyers and sellers can have more confidence in conducting transactions. Fraud attempts would also be lessened. Smart contracts are increasingly becoming admissible records with Vermont and Arizona passing such legislation. As such, smart contracts would have more enforceability beyond the technology itself.\n\n6. Costs\n\nThe transparency associated with a decentralized network can also trim down costs associated with real estate transactions. Beyond the savings made by cutting out intermediaries’ professional fees and commissions, there are other costs such as inspections costs, registration fees, loan fees, and taxes associated with real estate. These costs even vary depending on the territory that has jurisdiction. Like intermediaries, these can be reduced or even eliminated from the equation as platforms automate these processes and make them part of the system.\n\nGlobal real estate is worth hundreds of trillions of dollars, but is dominated by the wealthy and large corporations. Through blockchain technology, it is possible that more people will be able to access the market where transactions can be made more transparent, secure, and equitable. Real estate transactions may eventually become truly peer-to-peer activities with blockchain-powered platforms doing most of the work.\n\n",

    "summary": "Data shows social media users are currently not paying much attention to memecoins like Dogecoin as compared to Bitcoin and other top caps.\n\n",
    "content": "Data shows social media users are currently not paying much attention to memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) as compared to Bitcoin (BTC) and other top caps.\n\nAccording to data from the analytics firm Santiment, social media users are showing increased focus on the top layer 1 assets as compared to memecoin and other sectors. The indicator of relevance here is the “Social Dominance,” which is based on another metric called the Social Volume.\n\nThe Social Volume basically tells us about the amount of discussion that any given topic or term is receiving on the major social media platforms. The indicator makes this measurement by counting up all posts/threads/messages that make at least one mention of the keyword.\n\nThe reason that the indicator doesn’t simply count up the mentions themselves is so that just a few posts with a large amount of mentions can’t skew the value by themselves. When the Social Volume spikes, it means the users across social media are talking about the term and not just niche circles.\n\nNow, the Social Dominance, the actual indicator of interest here, keeps track of the percentage of the combined Social Volume of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap that a given coin or group of coins is occupying right now.\n\nBelow is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Social Dominance for four segments of the sector over the past month:\n\nAs displayed in the graph, the Social Dominance of the top 6 layer 1 assets has recently been the highest in the sector. “Layer 1” networks refer to those blockchains that handle their own security and aren’t built on top of another network. The networks that are built on these primary chains are titled Layer 2.\n\nSome of the top layer 1 coins are Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). While these layer 1 coins are enjoying a high dominance of discussions in the sector now, this wasn’t the case just earlier in the month.\n\nBack then, the other segments of the sector had been getting the focus instead. From the chart, it’s visible that the top layer 2 coins, like Polygon (MATIC) and the top meme coins, like Dogecoin, have been receiving notable talk on social media.\n\nWhile this does mean that investors aren’t interested in assets like Dogecoin right now, the fact that the focus is on Bitcoin and other top caps could actually be a bullish development for the sector as a whole.\n\n“Crypto’s consistent rises occur most often when there is a focus on top caps (a sign of caution) rather than more speculative assets (a sign of greed),” explains Santiment.\n\nAt the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.129, down more than 4% over the past week.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Coca-Cola and the U.S. State Department are using blockchain to combat forced labor in their supply chains.\n\n",
    "content": "A private-public initiative spearheaded by the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and the United States Department of State will use blockchain technology to combat forced labor in their supply chains. The announcement came following a report highlighting the extent of the problem across the world, and especially in the Asia-Pacific region, where Coca-Cola sources most of its sugarcane. A working group plans to tackle employee labor agreements and verification using smart contracts.\n\nThe partnership is part of Coca-Cola’s efforts to respond to criticisms that a large portion of its sugar cane supply is the product of forced labor. The company was at the center of a report by KnowTheChain, a partnership founded by Humanity United, a U.S.-based non-profit organization. Findings highlighted in the report demonstrated a serious need for systemic changes to the status quo and raised a variety of questions surrounding the company’s supply chain.\n\nCoke\u0027s efforts to bring transparency are not the first such initiative to recruit support from the private and public sectors. The United Nations also recently announced plans for a project to increase transparency and provide easy identity documents for all people. These programs highlight the increasing uses found for blockchain beyond the business realm. Such initiatives leverage the technology’s advantages as a positive force for social change.\n\nTackling Human Rights On the Supply Chain\n\nThe KTC study, which focused on Coca-Cola and 10 other companies worldwide, studied the food and beverage industry’s supply chains, eventually finding that these corporations do too little in the fight against forced labor. The problem is also pervasive in the region where many of these companies have large stakes. Per the International Labor Organization, almost 25 million people work in forced labor around the globe, with nearly half concentrated in Asia and the Pacific.\n\nIn the aftermath of the study, Coca-Cola committed to a series of 28 studies at the country level that will deal with land rights, child labor and forced labor in broader terms by 2020. The company’s priority will be to increase transparency across its supply chain whilst ensuring workers are both properly rewarded and protected by the law and its own corporate rules.\n\nThe beverage giant has also been exploring projects involving blockchain for some time now, looking for the right model to resolve persistent problems. The lack of transparency in hiring practices in the sector alongside an inability to properly monitor contracts and labor agreements means many times workers have no way to end their agreements or seek help. Similarly, these workers may lose their lands in disputes over a lack of proper documentation and murky bureaucratic processes.\n\nAimed At Better Labor Record-Keeping\n\nThe joint effort by the State Department and Coca-Cola will seek to directly address these problems by employing blockchain and smart contracts to deliver greater transparency and record-keeping regarding laborers and their contracts. The project also includes a collaboration with Blockchain Trust Accelerator – a non-profit that uses blockchain to deliver social impact world-wide – and will be developed by the Bitfury Group using Emercoin’s ledger services.\n\nBy deploying blockchain’s distributed ledger, the venture is working to build a secure registry for employees and contracts. In addition, an essential component of the work surrounds establishing higher verification standards to prevent forced labor and child labor. This is similar to existing technology which employs smart contracts to create more transparent agreements between parties and reduces the possibility of unfair labor practices. Moreover, there are several companies working in the supply chain management sector that are engaging blockchain to increase accountability and record-keeping quality. (See also: What is a Distributed Ledger?)To be sure, while viewed as a positive step, the project is not a panacea. Although blockchain-based systems can offer the benefits of transparency and accountability, they cannot force people to abide by them. Moreover, there are concerns that even if the program takes off, many laborers will not have access to the services. Of the individuals working in this group, many do not have smartphones or easy access to computers where they can take advantage of the future application. The group hopes, however, that a clear trail of evidence will make compliance a more likely outcome. (See also: Banks Claim They\u0027re Building Blockchains. They\u0027re Not.)Blockchain As a Force for Change\n\nCoca-Cola’s initiative is one more in a string of recent private-public partnerships aimed at tackling global problems using blockchain. In a similar announcement earlier this month, the United Nations revealed they are working with crypto wallet company Blockchain to explore a variety of use cases. This includes areas like voting rights and transparency, sustainable development, and resource conservation. ConsenSys, a group representing 22 organizations, is currently developing an incubator for social initiatives that use blockchain in humanitarian aid.\n\nThese ventures highlight the growing influence of blockchain, and a change in perception as the technology sheds its cryptocurrency origins to become a standalone offering. Its many benefits are also a strong fit for social endeavors as they create more transparent and democratic models that remove barriers to access.

    "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC made a groundbreaking announcement on July 22, 2024 to approve Ethereum ETFs. Crypto enthusiasts would be quick to spot that the Ethereum ETF approval was announced in May 2024. It is important to note that the firms which had received approval for Ethereum ETFs required valid registration statements. The SEC offered approval for the revised registration statements of issuers to launch ETFs on exchanges.\n\nMarket experts believed that the official approval for Ethereum would come by July 2, 2024. However, the US SEC returned the S-1 forms to the ETF issuers for revisions. After the approval for latest S-1 filings by issuers, Ethereum ETFs will be available for trading from July 23, 2024. Let us unravel more details about the approval for Ethereum ETFs and what it means for the crypto market.\n\nThe biggest sale of the year is live! Save up to 50% on Accredited Certifications and Learning Plans, use code MIDYEAR.\n\n\n\nThe final approval for Ethereum ETFs has propelled them into the limelight. One year of struggle for obtaining approval for ETH exchange-traded funds from the US SEC has finally turned into some positive news for the crypto landscape. Ethereum ETFs would enable traditional investors to tap into the potential of cryptocurrency investments. Bitcoin ETFs have proved the same by drawing more than $10 billion of investment after their launch in January 2024.\n\nThe impressive potential of Ether ETFs creates opportunities as well as the fear of risks. Which players took the initiative to launch ETH ETFs? The SEC has offered approval for eight ETFs by different issuers such as Fidelity, 21 Shares, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, VanEck, BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity and Invesco Galaxy. Grayscale takes a big leap by coming up with two ETFs that have unique pricing levels.\n\nLearn about the basic concepts of Ethereum, such as transactions, addresses, consensus, blocks, and important tools with the Ethereum Technology Course.\n\nThe approval for Ethereum ETFs is obviously exciting news for traditional investors. ETFs can help investors make the most of cryptocurrencies without the inherent risks and technical challenges. You might have some doubts regarding the places to access Ethereum ETF of your choice. The new spot ETH ETFs have everything to garner the attention of traditional investors towards opportunities in the crypto market.\n\nThe success of Bitcoin ETFs is also one of the reasons for which you would be curious about platforms where you can access Ether ETFs. Bloomberg has reported that you will find listings for most of the new Ether funds on the CBOE exchange. Popular exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange will also list ETFs such as the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, Grayscale Ethereum Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust. You can also choose NASDAQ for BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust ETF listings.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the popular blockchain network, Ethereum, and ensure overall, comprehensive skill development with Ethereum Skill Path\n\nBitcoin ETFs arrived in January 2024 and Ethereum ETFs are late to the party. First movers in the ETF market have a competitive advantage with a larger market share in the early stages. Many wealth managers, advisors and investors put their capital in the crypto space after the launch of Bitcoin ETFs. The launch of Ethereum ETF options on exchanges is definitely a surprise for many investors who have been following the ETF market closely.\n\nIt is important to note that the successful debut of Bitcoin ETFs has created concerns for the growth of ETH ETFs. Ethereum ETFs cannot become as popular as Bitcoin ETFs as Bitcoin enjoys a larger market share. On the other hand, investors who have invested capital in Bitcoin ETFs are less likely to shift to Ether funds. Many investors have reached the maximum limit of capital they can allocate to crypto with Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nInvestors also choose to refrain from selling Bitcoin ETFs to buy ETH ETFs as they want to avoid short-term capital gains taxes. The odds may be against Ether funds for the time being, considering the dominance of Bitcoin ETFs in the market. Industry experts believe that Ethereum ETFs would still have a formidable impact as they would be bigger than other ETFs. Investors would have the opportunity to gain more exposure in the crypto market by holding both Bitcoin and Ether funds.\n\nEnroll now in the Bitcoin Technology Course to learn about Bitcoin mining and the information contained in transactions and blocks.\n\nThe pricing of ETH is one of the notable concerns for investors and the crypto market after ETH ETF approval. You can find a general impression of the impact of Ethereum ETF approval on ETH pricing by looking at the example of Bitcoin ETFs. The success of Bitcoin ETFs made history as the exchange-traded funds garnered billions of dollars as investment in a few months. The pricing of Bitcoin reached new highs after the price increased by over 58% in two months.\n\nAnalysts believe that Ethereum ETFs may not be as successful as Bitcoin ETFs in terms of influx of investments. The pricing of Ether decreased by 1.5% after the announcement of approval by SEC to list ETH ETFs on public exchanges. Expert predictions point out that the price of ETF may grow up to $6,500 in the long run. Research firms also suggest that the new Ether funds could garner around $15 billion to $20 billion in investment in the first year.\n\nOne of the most important highlights of the newly launched ETH ETFs is the restriction on staking. Ethereum exchange-traded funds could not stake the Ether they are investing in. Staking can allow investors to earn additional returns on their ETH assets for securing the Ethereum blockchain. However, the regulatory concerns related to staking were a major point of concern for regulatory bodies while considering approvals for ETH ETFs. The barrier to staking reduces the potential of Ethereum ETFs to offer significant returns to investors.\n\nThe approval for Ethereum ETFs marks a revolutionary milestone in the evolution of the cryptocurrency landscape. Investors can use any Ethereum ETF on a public exchange to make the most of crypto investments without worrying about ownership or technical challenges of cryptocurrencies. The new Ether funds have a lot of challenges to overcome, especially from Bitcoin ETFs, to become a significant attraction for investors. Ethereum ETFs have the potential to become popular as one of the early movers in the ETF market and with their diverse advantages.\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer: The article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide any investment advice.

    "content": "Machine learning deserves more scrutiny than ever due to the growing adoption of ML applications. The development and assessment of ML models have become more complex with the use of larger datasets, new learning requirements, innovative algorithms, and diverse implementation approaches.\n\nTherefore, it is important to pay attention to bias and variance in machine learning to ensure that machine learning models don’t make any false assumptions or get filled up with noise. Machine learning models must have the perfect balance between bias and variance to generate results with better accuracy.\n\nIn the development phase, all the algorithms would have some form of variance and bias. You can correct ML models for bias or variance, albeit without the possibility of reducing them to zero. Let us learn more about bias \u0026 variance alongside their implications for new machine-learning models.\n\n\n\nBefore learning about bias and variance, it is important to figure out why you should learn the two concepts. ML algorithms rely on statistical or mathematical models that may feature two types of inherent errors, such as reducible errors and irreducible errors. Irreducible errors are naturally evident in an ML model, while reducible errors can be controlled and reduced to improve accuracy.\n\nThe elements of bias and variance in ML are perfect examples of reducible errors that you can control. Reduction of errors would demand selection of models with the desired flexibility and complexity alongside access to relevant training data. Therefore, data scientists and ML researchers must have an in-depth understanding of how bias is different from variance.\n\nTake your first step towards learning about artificial intelligence through AI Flashcards\n\nBias refers to the systematic error that emerges from wrong assumptions made by the ML model in the training process. You can also explain bias in machine learning in mathematical terms as the error emerging from squared bias. It represents the extent to which the prediction of an ML model is different when compared to the target value for specific training data. The origins of bias error revolve around simplification of assumptions within ML models for easier approximation of the end results.\n\nModel selection is one of the reasons for introducing bias in ML models. Data scientists may also implement resampling to repeat the model development process and derive the average prediction outputs. Resampling of data focuses on extraction of new samples by leveraging datasets to achieve better accuracy in results. Some of the recommended methods for data resampling include bootstrapping and k-fold resampling.\n\nThe overview of bias and variance in machine learning also points to the ways in which resampling could influence bias. ML models are likely to have a higher level of bias when average final results are not the same as the actual value in training data. All algorithms have some type of bias as they emerge from assumptions made by the model to learn the target function easily. Higher bias can result in underfitting as the model cannot capture the relationship between model features and outputs. High-bias models have more generalized perceptions about the end results or target functions.\n\nLinear algorithms have a higher bias, thereby ensuring a faster learning process. Bias is the result of approximation of complicated real-life problems with a significantly simpler model in linear regression analysis. Even if linear algorithms can feature bias, it leads to easily comprehensible outputs. Simpler algorithms are more likely to introduce more bias than non-linear algorithms.\n\nWant to understand the importance of ethics in AI, ethical frameworks, principles, and challenges?

The explanation for variance in machine learning also focuses on how it represents the variation of random variables from the expected value. You can measure variance by using a specific training set. It serves as a clear overview of the inconsistency in different predictions when you use diverse training sets. However, variance is not a trusted indicator of the overall accuracy of an ML algorithm.\n\nVariance is generally responsible for overfitting, which leads to magnification of small variations in the dataset used for training. Models with higher variance could also have training datasets that showcase random noise rather than target functions. On top of it, the models can also determine the connections between output variables and input data.\n\nModels with lower variance suggest that the sample data is closer to the desired state of the model. On the other hand, high-variance models are likely to showcase massive changes in the predictions for the target functions. Examples of high-variance models include k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and SVMs or support vector machines. On the other hand, linear regression, linear discriminant analysis, and logistic regression models are examples of low-variance ML algorithms.\n\n\n\nThe ideal way to fight against bias and variance in ML algorithms can help you create ML models with better performance. You can find different methods to address the problem of bias in ML models to improve accuracy. First of all, you can go for a more complex model. Oversimplification of the model is one of the common reasons for higher bias, as it could not capture the complexities in training data.\n\nTherefore, you have to make the ML model more complex by reducing the number of hidden layers for deep neural networks. On the other hand, you can choose more complex models, such as recurrent neural networks for sequence learning and convolutional neural networks for image processing. Complex models such as polynomial regression models can serve as the ideal fit for non-linear datasets.\n\nYou can deal with bias in ML algorithms by increasing the number of features that would improve the complexity of ML models. As a result, it would have better abilities for capturing the underlying patterns you can find in the data. Furthermore, expanding the size of the training data for ML models can help in reducing bias as the model would have more examples for learning from the training datasets.\n\nRegularization of the model through techniques like L1 or L2 regularization can help in preventing overfitting alongside improving generalization features of the model. If you reduce the strength of regularization or remove it in a model with higher bias, then you can enhance its performance by huge margins.\n\nEnroll in our new Certified ChatGPT Professional Certification Course to master real-world use cases with hands-on training. Gain practical skills, enhance your AI expertise, and unlock the potential of ChatGPT in various professional settings.\n\nML researchers and developers must also know the best practices to reduce variance in ML algorithms to achieve better performance. You can find a clear difference between bias and variance in machine learning by identifying the measures followed for reducing variance. The most common remedial measure for variance in ML algorithms is cross-validation.\n\nIt involves splitting the data into training and testing datasets many times for identification of overfitting or underfitting in a model. In addition, cross-validation can help in tuning hyperparameters for reduction of variance. Selection of the only relevant features can help in reducing complexity of the model, thereby reducing variance error.\n\nReduction of model complexity through reduction of the number of layers or parameters in neural networks can help reduce variance and improve generalization performance. You can reduce variance in machine learning with the help of L1 or L2 regularization techniques. Researchers and developers can also rely on ensemble methods such as stacking, bagging, and boosting to enhance generalization performance and reduce variance.\n\nAnother trusted technique for reducing variance in ML algorithms is early stopping, which helps in preventing overfitting. It involves stopping the deep learning model training when you don’t find any improvement in performance on the validation set.\n\nCurious about Machine Learning Interview? Read here Top 20 Machine Learning Interview Questions And Answers now!\n\nThe discussions about bias and variance in machine learning also invite attention to bias-variance tradeoff. It is important to remember that bias and variance have an inverse relationship, thereby suggesting that you cannot have ML models with low bias and variance or high bias and variance. Data engineers working on ML algorithms to ensure alignment with a specific dataset can lead to lower bias, albeit with higher variance. As a result, the model would align with the dataset alongside improving possibilities of inaccuracy in predictions.\n\nThe same situation is applicable in scenarios where you create a low variance model that showcases higher bias. It may reduce the risk of inaccuracy in predictions, albeit with a lack of alignment between the model and the dataset. The bias-variance tradeoff refers to the balance between bias and variance. You can address the bias-variance tradeoff by increasing the training dataset and the complexity of the model. It is also important to remember that the type of model plays a major role in determining the tradeoff.\n\nIdentify new ways to leverage the full potential of generative AI in business use cases and become an expert in generative AI technologies with Generative AI Skill Path\n\nThe review of the difference between bias and variance in machine learning shows that it is important to address these two factors before creating any ML algorithm. Variance and bias errors are major influences on the possibilities for overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. Therefore, the accuracy of ML models depends significantly on bias and variance. At the same time, it is also important to ensure the right balance between variance and bias.

    "content": "Blockchains are a radical new computing model where data and applications are secured not by centralized intermediaries but by a decentralized network of computers. Due to their permissionless nature, blockchains enable anyone to opt-in and begin independently verifying the integrity of computations, resulting in a checks and balances system between users and network operators.\n\nFrom the creation of new digital currencies with programmatic monetary policies (e.g. Bitcoin) to the execution of programmable trust-minimized applications (e.g. Ethereum), blockchains are rapidly entering the public consciousness as a new form of digital infrastructure, often referred to as Web3. However, while the overarching value proposition of blockchains is recognized by many, the nuances regarding the underlying trust model of blockchains are often misunderstood.\n\nThis article will serve to explain how the trust model of blockchains differs from traditional computing by looking at the role of self-verifying full nodes, with particular reference to how they keep block producers (e.g. miners/validators) accountable and how decreasing the cost of verification is at the heart of blockchain scalability.\n\nThe computing model used by most applications today involves a client-server model where requests are sent to a centralized database server. The participants within the traditional computing model can be broken down into the following:Often referred to as “Web2,” this computing model empowers developers to quickly launch and scale applications on-demand. Users are also provided with a seamless user experience due to low-latency and high-throughput computation facilitated by data centers. While applications hosted on centralized databases provide immense value to billions of users around the world, they carry certain limitations.\n\nMost notably, end-users have no way to verify that the computation involved in producing a response to a request is legitimate or that the database entries have not been manipulated over time. Such applications effectively operate in a black box, meaning users must fully trust that third-party intermediates will act in their best interests.\n\nThe trust assumptions associated with centrally hosted applications can negatively impact users, who can experience financial censorship, social media deplatforming, leaks of their personal data, manipulative content selection algorithms, increased reconciliation costs, corrupted data and data loss, and an overall lack of accountability. The end result is a breakdown in societal trust and an increase in the cost of economic coordination.\n\nRather than trusting the good faith of centralized intermediaries, blockchains introduce trust-minimization and credible neutrality by using:Importantly, blockchains are open networks—anyone in the world can join as either an active contributor or a passive listener. This allows end-users to verify for themselves that any output produced by the network is valid and that ledger entries have not been tampered with. The transparency of blockchains also mitigates risks around opacity, eliminating information asymmetry and ensuring information regarding risk exposure is available to all participants.\n\nTo ensure the proper operation of a blockchain, there are various (often overlapping) categories of network participants that each play a crucial role.\n\nWhile each of these network participants plays a key role in blockchain ecosystems, full nodes operate at the heart of a blockchain network as they are the entities responsible for maintaining full replicas of the network’s ledger. Other network participants, such as block producers and light clients, connect to full nodes to stay informed on the state of the network. The resulting network topography is illustrated below.\n\nA common misconception about blockchains is that since block producers are responsible for generating new blocks containing transactions, then they must unilaterally control a blockchain. Put another way, the belief is that if a majority of BPs are corrupted/colluding (commonly known as a 51% attack), then the network is wholly compromised and everything of value can be irrevocably destroyed. In reality, BPs have a limited scope of power, where only specific types of malicious activity can take place.\n\nWhat block producers can do:What block producers cannot do:To understand why the power of BPs is inherently limited, it is important to understand the relationship between BPs and self-verifying full nodes.\n\nWhile BPs ensure the liveness of a blockchain by proposing new blocks, they do not determine the validity of blocks on behalf of the network. Rather, it is the role of full nodes—which store a personal copy of the blockchain’s ledger—to independently validate each block and execute all the transactions contained within to determine whether the protocol’s rules are being followed.\n\nThe result is a checks and balances system where full nodes hold BPs accountable by only accepting valid blocks and ignoring blocks that do not conform to the protocol rules. As such, BPs are economically incentivized to only produce valid blocks, as otherwise they would waste economic resources by producing invalid blocks and forfeit any block reward and transaction fees they could have earned. Even if other BPs build valid blocks on top of an invalid block, these blocks will all be ignored by full nodes, resulting in such BPs effectively forking themselves off the network.\n\nFull nodes are operated by key economic actors within a blockchain’s ecosystem, including cryptocurrency exchanges, stablecoin issuers, oracles, layer-2 validators, RPC providers, custody wallet providers, large crypto asset holders, and average users alike. By self-verifying a blockchain’s ledger, these key economic actors cannot be tricked into accepting invalid blocks. Full nodes do not need to coordinate/communicate with each other to determine if a block is valid either. Rather, by following the protocol’s rules when checking blocks, they will all arrive at the same conclusion regarding block validity.\n\nWith many blockchains, the protocol rules are determined by the community off-chain in a process known as social consensus. This typically involves a formalized process (e.g. Ethereum Improvement Proposals or EIPs), where the community debates the merits of any protocol rule change on various social channels. Once rough off-chain consensus is achieved, blockchain core developers write a new version of the blockchain software client, which implements these changes. Full nodes and BPs can then choose whether or not to run this new software to upgrade the network via a hard fork (non-backward-compatible change) or a soft fork (backward-compatible change).\n\nIf a hard fork upgrade is contentious, then the network may experience a chain split where two different versions of a blockchain are created and individually maintained. Once a split occurs, each blockchain will have a shared history from the genesis block up to the specific block height at which the split occurred. This was seen with the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash hard fork in 2017, when differences arose on how to scale transaction throughput. It was also seen in the Ethereum/Ethereum Classic hard fork in 2016, when differences arose on how to handle The DAO hack.\n\nIn contrast to off-chain consensus, other blockchains have chosen to handle upgrades via on-chain governance, with a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governed by token-holders determining protocol rule changes. Either method of facilitating protocol upgrades presents its own unique benefits and challenges, and the method used depends on the needs of the community.\n\nIf the hardware requirements for operating a full node are too high (e.g. non-consumer hardware is required), then fewer entities will be capable of or willing to run a full node, instead, relying on centralized solutions to read/write to the blockchain. This can result in a blockchain network becoming more vulnerable to exploitation from BPs.\n\nTo support a healthy network of full nodes, many blockchains purposely limit the transaction throughput of the network to that of the lowest spec computer that the community desires to self-verify the ledger. Low hardware requirements not only help those who wish to run a full node during normal operations, but also make it easier to spin up a new self-verifying full node if the blockchain is actively being attacked by a colluding group of BPs. The exact hardware requirements necessary to stay fully synchronized to the network vary from blockchain to blockchain, however, a common target goal is average consumer hardware.\n\nThe following logic describes how low hardware requirements lead to the core value proposition of blockchains:Low hardware requirements → low cost to verify blocks → more entities can run full nodes → stronger resistance to BP attacks → increased network security → superior credible neutrality → increased adoptionWhile the minimum hardware requirements capable of running a full node are not explicitly defined in the rules of a blockchain protocol (improvements in hardware/software efficiency is perpetually occurring), the transaction throughput rules of a blockchain (commonly determined by the size and frequency of blocks) are tuned to target a specific range of device specifications.\n\nAlthough targeting average consumer hardware is a common approach, some blockchains opt to target beefier server-grade hardware as the minimum hardware requirements for verification in order to increase transaction throughput. This comes with the acknowledgment that while fewer entities may be able to self-verify the ledger using self-hosted equipment, a sufficient number of key economic actors may still have the resources necessary to run a full node.\n\nEveryone in the world running their own full node to self-verify a blockchain is an idealistic goal. However, in practice, the time and resources required to spin up a full node may introduce too much friction for many end-users. As blockchains become more widely adopted, users familiar with trusting centralized service providers may find the process of setting up a full node too cumbersome, and would rather be able to immediately start interacting with on-chain applications.\n\nAs a result, most end-users of widely used blockchains today do not run their own full node, but rather connect to and implicitly trust RPC providers to relay transactions to the network and inform them on the current state of a blockchain. Such users may not enjoy the full self-verification benefits of blockchains and the security of the network is not as strong as it could be, however, it is still an order of magnitude improvement in trust-minimization over traditional computing models.\n\nA middle-ground solution to this problem could entail the integration of light clients into blockchain wallets. While this would be an improvement over the status quo by reducing trust in RPC providers, light clients still implicitly trust that the majority of BPs are producing valid blocks and that all of the transaction data within a block has been made publicly available.\n\nIn order for light clients to verify the work of BPs without simply downloading and executing the entire block (i.e. running a full node), technical improvements in light client implementations can increase their trust-minimization properties, resulting in what can be considered “trust-minimized light clients”. These technical improvements can include:As additional trust-minimization techniques are created and deployed successfully in production, the cost and friction of verifying the work of block producers without downloading and executing entire blocks improve, leading to more secure blockchain networks. Notably, the methods of creating trust-minimized light clients can even enable more scalable blockchain networks to emerge.\n\nScaling a blockchain is commonly thought of as being equivalent to increasing transaction throughput. However, a more holistic interpretation would be increasing transaction throughput while maintaining a low verification cost. Thanks to the properties of trust-minimized light clients, the throughput of a blockchain network can be increased (e.g. increasing block size and/or block interval time) yet still retain the low verification costs required to keep BPs accountable.\n\nFurthermore, layer-2 scaling solutions such as rollups leverage similar techniques as trust-minimized light clients by using cryptographic proofs to prove transaction validity without the blockchain network needing to execute every transaction. In this case, the blockchain operates an enshrined trust-minimized light client for the layer-2 rollup. Combined with transaction batching and storage of transaction data on-chain for data availability, transaction throughput can be increased by multiple orders of magnitude with minimal to no additional verification costs imposed on the underlying blockchain.\n\nBlockchain are highly secure, credibly neutral, and transparent append-only ledgers that offer a new paradigm for computing. By incorporating a checks and balances system between block producers and full nodes, a blockchain can serve the needs of its community and evolve over time while also remaining resistant to manipulation. While more work needs to be done to lower verification costs, blockchains in their current state still offer an order of magnitude increase in trust-minimization over traditional computing models.\n\n—The opinions expressed within this post are solely the author’s and do not reflect the opinions and beliefs of the Chainlink Foundation or Chainlink Labs.\n\n",

    "content": "Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin at spot rates, holding firm above the support zone between $3,000 and $3,300. Although prices retraced yesterday, with the July 29 bar closing with a long upper wick pointing to weakness, ETH holders are upbeat, expecting gains above $4,000.\n\nAs Ethereum rejects lower lows and cements its place at second in the market cap leaderboard, other developments could spark demand in the coming sessions.\n\nTaking to X, analyst Leon Waidmann noted that a record 28% of all ETH in circulation has been locked, an all-time high. According to CryptoQuant data, as of July 29, 33.3 million ETH were locked.\n\nParallel data from Beaconcha.in reveals that there are over one million validators. At the same time, over 33.6 million ETH have been staked. Additionally, of all the validators helping secure and process transactions, each operating node has locked 32.06 ETH on average.\n\nWhile more ETH continues to be staked, on-chain data also reveals that holders are concurrently pulling more coins from leading exchanges. As of July 30, CryptoQuant data shows that all crypto exchanges held just 16.6 million ETH. It is down from the 32.5 million under their control three years ago in July 2021.\n\nUsually, the more ETH is pulled from exchanges, the more confident holders are. Through Binance or Coinbase, users can easily swap tokens for other assets, including Bitcoin or stablecoins. Given this, that they are moving their coins away from these platforms means either they are keen on holding or engaging in other ecosystem activities like decentralized finance (DeFi) via portals like Maker or even staking for an annual yield.\n\nThe combination of ETH moving from exchanges and holders choosing to stake makes the coin more scarce. Moreover, the availability of spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States is also expected to increase the demand for ETH. Therefore, as the coin becomes scarce, demand from this derivative product may push prices higher.\n\n\n\nFrom the daily chart, ETH has found resistance at $3,500. If the coin finds support from around the $3,000 to $3,300 zone, ETH may likely float higher.\n\n",

    "content": "The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with anticipation as two prominent digital assets, Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), make headlines. With Solana’s meteoric rise and Mpeppe’s promising presale phase, investors are eager to see substantial returns. Here’s a deep dive into why now could be the perfect time to invest in these two tokens.\n\nSolana (SOL) has been making waves in the crypto market, solidifying its position among the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. As of today, Solana (SOL) is trading at $181.88 per SOL/USD, with a market cap of $84.54 billion USD and a 24-hour trading volume of $3.21 billion USD. Despite a slight dip of 5.2% in the last 24 hours, Solana’s overall performance remains robust, driven by several key factors.\n\nSince October 2023, Solana’s price has surged nearly 750%, showcasing its resilience and strong market performance. The current sentiment around Solana (SOL) is bullish, with a Fear-Greed Index at 68, indicating strong investor confidence. This positive momentum is reflected in Solana’s (SOL) trading above both the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), which suggests further potential for gains.\n\nSolana’s (SOL) recent price trajectory has been bullish, with the token trading well above the crucial psychological level of $170. After a brief dip in April 2024, where Solana’s price dropped from around $200 to $135, the recent bullish momentum has brought it back close to $180. Analysts predict that if Solana’s price breaks above $173 by the end of the month, it could target a range between $190 and $200, a significant psychological area for traders.\n\nKey market participants, including whales, have been actively accumulating Solana (SOL) in large quantities. Recent reports from iCrypto.ai show that Solana ranks second in accumulation, just behind ENS. Notably, a significant wallet made another accumulation move, swapping $102K worth of WBTC for Solana (SOL) at a price of $189.5. This consistent accumulation by large holders underscores the strong market confidence in Solana’s (SOL) future performance.\n\nWhile Solana (SOL) continues to capture the attention of institutional investors, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is rapidly gaining traction among retail investors. Currently in Stage 2 of its presale, Mpeppe is trading at $0.00107 USDT, with nearly 60% of the tokens already sold. This rapid uptake highlights the growing excitement and investor confidence in Mpeppe’s potential.\n\nMpeppe (MPEPE) stands out in the meme coin space by offering real utility through its integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming platforms. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, Mpeppe provides tangible value to its users, making it a unique investment opportunity. This combination of utility and fun makes Mpeppe an attractive option for investors looking for high returns.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Mpeppe (MPEPE), predicting a potential rally of up to 600%. The early investment opportunity in Mpeppe presents a chance for substantial returns, driven by the coin’s innovative approach and strong market presence. With the presale already showing significant progress, Mpeppe is well-positioned to make millionaires out of its early investors.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, both Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer exciting opportunities for investors. Solana’s (SOL) strong market performance, bullish technical indicators, and whale accumulation signal a potential surge to $200 this week. On the other hand, Mpeppe’s promising presale and unique value proposition make it a compelling investment for those looking to capitalize on the meme coin craze.\n\nFor investors looking to diversify their portfolios and maximize gains, both Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe present compelling cases. The smart contract address for Mpeppe (MPEPE) is 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B. As these two tokens continue to attract attention and investment, the future looks bright for both Solana and Mpeppe in the ever-competitive cryptocurrency landscape.\n\n\n\nFor more information on the Mpeppe (MPEPE) Presale:\n\nVisit Mpeppe (MPEPE)\n\nJoin and become a community member:\n\nhttps://t.me/mpeppecoin\n\nhttps://x.com/mpeppecommunity?s\u003d11\u0026t\u003dhQv3guBuxfglZI-0YOTGuQ\n\n",

    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) outperformed the broader crypto market during the Asia trading day, adding 4.4% to test $67,000 while the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) rose 3.3%.\n\nSolana’s SOL jumped over 5% to lead gains among major tokens, CoinGecko data shows, with ether (ETH), BNB Chain’s BNB and Cardano’s ADA adding 3%. Dogecoin (DOGE) rose 4%, while Solana-based memecoin popcat (POPCAT) jumped more than 8% to lead gains in that category.\n\nFor the third day, ether products led liquidations across crypto futures, with over $70 million in longs liquidated compared with $55 million on BTC-tracked futures.\n\nOpen interest – or the number of unsettled futures bets – dropped by $1 billion over the past 24 hours, indicative of money leaving the market.\n\nAccording to data from SoSoValue, bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) added a net $31.16 million, bringing the cumulative net flow since their introduction in January to just under $17.5 billion. Total net assets of the ETFs amount to $59.14 billion, or about 4.6% of the entire market cap of the largest cryptocurrency.\n\nEther, the second-largest, rose 2.8% to top $3,200, according to CoinDesk Indices data. The ether ETFs experienced a net daily outflow of $152 million, SoSoValue data shows. Current cumulative flow for the ETFs since they started trading this week is negative $178.68 million. That\u0027s mainly owing to withdrawals from Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which converted to an ETF.\n\n\"This situation is very similar to the bitcoin ETF product launches at the beginning of the year,\" CoinShares analysts said in an emailed note.\n\nOutflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world\u0027s largest bitcoin fund at the time, which converted from a closed-end structure into an ETF that allowed redemptions for the first time in 10 years, weighed on bitcoin\u0027s price over the first weeks. Later, inflows to rival funds overcame the negative trend, propelling BTC to an all-time high in March.\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Trust is following the same path but faster, making the decline a \"prime buying opportunity,\" said Mads Eberhardt, a crypto analyst at Steno Research.\n\n\"If this trend continues, the outflow from the Grayscale Ethereum ETF could end much quicker than it did for bitcoin in January, perhaps as early as mid-next week,\" Eberhardt said. \"After this, we estimate we will see strong net inflow, due to the inflow into the other ETFs as observed over the last few days.\"\n\nRachel Lin, CEO and co-founder of SynFutures, disagreed, saying she expects short-term pain for ETH traders.\n\n“As we saw with Bitcoin, Grayscale\u0027s ETH ETF fund is becoming a net seller on the market with over $810 million in outflow since the ETF launch,” Lin said in an email to CoinDesk.\n\n“Grayscale currently holds over $8 billion worth of Ether, and nearly 10% of it was sold in just the past two days. If the trend continues, Grayscale might reach the 50% mark far sooner than with Bitcoin. However, that would also mean more downside for Ethereum.\"\n\nLooking away from BTC and ETH, AAVE, the native token of the Aave decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol is up 15% as the market reacted to a token buyback proposal.\n\nThe proposal, which is currently in a \"temp check\" phase, where feedback is solicited, would contribute more protocol revenue to buying back AAVE tokens from the secondary market and redistributing them to stakers.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "The future is on. The replatforming of capital markets into on-chain finance is projected to disrupt more than $867 trillion in global asset value.\n\nPowering this transformation is the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), a breakthrough in blockchain connectivity and interoperability that enables DeFi applications to access users and interface with other DeFi applications across different blockchains, all from a single interface. CCIP also gives existing financial systems a seamless connection to public and private blockchains—making it easy for them to transition existing assets and financial services on-chain. If successful, we could see trillions of dollars in new assets flow into blockchain ecosystems.\n\nOver the past few years, the cross-chain ecosystem has experienced growing pains, as previous cross-chain solutions have suffered a number of exploits due to poor design choices, large attack surfaces, and complex user experiences. Over $2.6B has been exploited due to cross-chain bridge hacks thus far. What the market needs is a cross-chain solution with a higher standard of security, reliability, and usability.\n\n64% of funds stolen in DeFi hacks in 2022 were from cross-chain bridge hacks, according to Chainalysis.\n\n1/ The Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) has officially launched on Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon mainnets.#LinkTheWorld pic.twitter.com/SdLVyaapg3— Chainlink (@chainlink) July 17, 2023Pioneered by a world-class research team, CCIP raises the bar in cross-chain security by introducing new features, such as rate limits on token transfers as a way to minimize potential damage and the Risk Management Network—an independent network that verifies cross-chain operations for erroneous activity. CCIP also establishes new standards in cross-chain reliability and usability by introducing features such as Smart Execution—a gas-locked fee payment mechanism where users only need to pay on the source chain and CCIP will take care of execution on the destination chain.\n\nUnderpinning these new features is the same Chainlink foundation of decentralized oracle networks that have already helped secure tens of billions of dollars for DeFi protocols and enabled over $12 trillion in on-chain transaction value.\n\nCCIP is now running live on Mainnet for Early Access participants, which include two leading DeFi protocols:“Security is critical when dealing with on-chain assets, which is why we leverage Chainlink CCIP for our cross-chain Synths Teleporter.”—Kain Warwick, Founder, SynthetixHundreds of trillions of dollars flow across global financial markets. Universal and frictionless connectivity across financial markets is a massive value-add for all participants, which is why widely adopted financial market infrastructure providers such as DTCC, Euroclear, and Swift exist.\n\nWhile 97% of institutional investors agree that “tokenization will revolutionize asset management,” there have been two long-standing roadblocks to moving hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of assets on-chain:CCIP overcomes these challenges. In a recently announced collaboration with Swift, Chainlink CCIP is helping enable end-to-end communication between legacy systems and blockchain networks, as well as interoperability across both public and private blockchains. Over a dozen major global financial institutions and financial market infrastructure providers are participating in the collaboration, including DTCC, BNY Mellon, Citi, and Euroclear.\n\n“[This collaboration] will also highlight the potential value of using a blockchain interoperability protocol to securely transfer data and value between legacy systems and a potentially unlimited number of blockchains.”—Jonathan Ehrenfeld, Head of Securities Strategy at SwiftToday, the world’s contractual value is fragmented across both the existing financial system and the multi-chain Web3 ecosystem. The fragmentation of blockchain networks is similar to the early days of the Internet, where there were separate intranets, LANs, and consortiums of terminals that couldn’t interact with one another.\n\nThe early interoperability standards completely transformed the Internet. TCP/IP, HTTP, and email protocols enabled seamless connectivity between users, who then saw their web applications increase in value exponentially as more people joined the network.\n\nIt shouldn’t matter what blockchain you launch a dApp or token on or what type of backend system you want to interact from—as long as that environment is connected to an interoperability standard, it can access any chain and its supported dApps.\n\nNow, CCIP provides a connectivity standard that enables traditional finance to easily interact with smart contracts, as well as securely transact across different public and private blockchains. Connectivity both to and across multiple blockchains is critical for creating a unified financial system where tokens and messages can seamlessly flow across different environments.\n\nSimilar to TCP/IP’s foundational role in Internet communication, Chainlink CCIP is the foundation for an interoperable blockchain ecosystem. The key difference between TCP/IP and CCIP is that while TCP/IP enables information to flow freely across the Internet, CCIP enables value to be transferred across networks securely. The launch of CCIP marks a key moment in the evolution of the Internet and moves society one step closer to a world underpinned by interoperable smart contracts: The Internet of Contracts.\n\n“Just like key standards such as TCP/IP remade a fragmented early internet into the single global internet we all know and use today, we are making CCIP to connect the fragmented public blockchain landscape and the growing bank chain ecosystem into a single Internet of Contracts.”—Chainlink Co-Founder, Sergey NazarovBecoming the industry standard across both bank chains and public blockchains positions CCIP to become the universal connectivity layer bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3. We envision a future where Web3 and the global financial system are largely one and the same, with vast amounts of value flowing across these systems and chains via CCIP.\n\nBy connecting these two worlds, the extensive liquidity and technological infrastructure already present in the global financial system can take advantage of the transparency, efficiency, and connectivity advantages now available through blockchains. Given the massive size of the global banking system, if even a small fraction of assets move on-chain and connect to the Internet of Contracts, the Web3 ecosystem could grow exponentially.\n\nIf you are interested in using Chainlink as a gateway to on-chain finance, reach out to our experts.\n\n",

    "title": "Permissioned Blockchain: Definition, Examples, Vs. Permissionless",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Permissioned blockchains require participants to identify themselves and assign defined roles to perform only permitted activities.\n\nPermissioned blockchains provide an additional level of security over typical blockchain systems like Bitcoin, as they require an access control layer. These blockchains are favored by entities that require security, identity, and role definition within the blockchain. Permissioned blockchains are becoming more common as businesses realize their benefits.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Permissioned Blockchain?\n\nA permissioned blockchain is a distributed ledger that is not publicly accessible. It can only be accessed by users with permission. The users can only perform specific actions granted to them by the ledger administrators and are required to identify themselves through certificates or other digital means.\n\nYou might consider the addition of permissioned users as an extra blockchain security system. Administrators maintain an access control layer to allow certain actions to be performed only by certain identifiable participants. Records are kept within the blockchain of who is involved in the transactions. This makes permissioned blockchains different from public blockchains.\n\nUnderstanding Permissioned Blockchains\n\nA blockchain can be built and accessed in multiple ways. Some blockchains need special permissions to read, access, and write information. Others only require that you have the ability to connect and conduct work for the network. The intrinsic configuration of each blockchain controls the participants\u0027 transactions and defines the roles in which each participant can access and contribute to the blockchain.\n\nIt may also include maintaining the identity of each blockchain participant on the network.\n\nDifference Between Permissionless and Permissioned Blockchains\n\nPermissioned blockchains are similar to permissionless blockchains because they use the same technologies. However, the main difference is in how they are accessed and who can access them.\n\nFor example, a bank may be running a permissioned blockchain operated through a designated number of nodes internal to the bank to track money transfers. You cannot access this type of blockchain because you won\u0027t have the permissions required. In contrast, you could join a permissionless blockchain like a cryptocurrency mining network once you have downloaded the appropriate software and directed it toward the network and your wallet.\n\nMuch of the inner workings of the blockchains are the same. The key differences between them are:Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency permissionless blockchain, allows anyone to participate in the network in the capacity of a full node or a contributing miner. Anyone can take a read-only role or make legitimate changes to the blockchain, like adding a new block or maintaining a full copy of the entire blockchain.\n\nAs blockchain uses grow and mature, more businesses and governments have realized the cost-saving benefits the technology introduces into an organization. As a result, permissioned blockchains have become popular among industry-level firms and enterprises, for which security, identity, and role definition are essential.\n\nFor instance, a manufacturer producing a product may use a permissioned blockchain that ties into its supply chain management. The transactions on this blockchain would likely involve logistics partners, financing banks, and other vendors involved in the supply and financing processes. Each entity would have its own level of transparency and permissions that it could use to streamline operations, track inventory, or monitor spending and invoicing.\n\nPermissionless blockchains are decentralized in that they allow for more users and can extend across a much larger network. On the other hand, permissioned blockchains have limited decentralization as they are generally used for enterprise and business purposes, requiring various amounts of centralization.\n\nMany permissionless blockchains are open-source, which means that a community develops them. They can be accessed and used by anyone. Permissioned blockchains are generally proprietary and controlled by the developers or the business using them.\n\nA developer building a permissioned blockchain may opt to make a few select records, like product names and quantities involved in transactions, available for everyone to read. However, they might allow only select participants to view the transaction price. Other implementations may include limiting participants to act as nodes on the network, enhancing the network\u0027s security.\n\nAll such permissioning and profile maintenance is handled by this access-control layer. These differ from the permissionless or public blockchain networks, which don\u0027t have a control layer.\n\nPermissionless blockchains are much less transparent since they provide a certain amount of anonymity for the users. Wallet addresses cannot generally be tracked back to the blockchain users due to the encryption methods used. However, blockchains that facilitate payments are much more transparent than traditional payment methods because transaction amounts and addresses are usually publicly available.\n\nPermissioned blockchains require more transparency at certain levels since they are used for conducting business. Nodes, or the users and their connections, are known and their transactions are visible. Among many other benefits, this can prevent a company from double invoicing, spending, paying, or any other number of errors that can be made using enterprise management programs.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPermissioned blockchains are distributed ledgers that only allow access to users who have been granted access. They are used in specific circumstances, such as business or government applications, to secure data and information.\n\n",

Depending on how the speech goes, as well as the conference’s overall performance we might see the BRC-20 rally continue.\n\n\n\nThe former US president and presidential candidate has taken an extremely pro-crypto stance, stating he will make the United States the global leader in crypto if elected. Experts like the founder of 10x research Markus Thielen expect Trump to win the 2024 election causing a massive rally.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin nearly always grows with large events regarding the presidential candidate, pumping recently with his assassination attempt predicted to increase his odds of winning the election. This, in turn, leads to large movements across the BRC-20 space.\n\nThere are also rumors that Trump may make Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset if elected. This could lead to a parabolic move in the value of BTC and BRC-20 tokens.\n\nAmidst this anticipation, investors are looking at a new BRC-20 project still in the presale stage that could be poised for massive returns.\n\nThe 99Bitcoins token (99BTC) is an innovative BRC-20 project in its penultimate presale stage.

    "content": "Cryptocurrencies showed the world that it is possible to solve the problems associated with traditional financial services. Bitcoin paved the path for the growth of cryptocurrencies and disrupted the financial services sector with decentralization and cryptographic security. Big brands such as Microsoft and AT\u0026T accept Bitcoin payments and an NBA team also allows customers to purchase game tickets with Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies have the potential to gain the attention of customers in the era of digital payments.\n\nBusinesses can leverage Bitcoin as a proven solution for expanding their reach in markets where traditional banking is not available. Cryptocurrencies can help businesses offer a new payment option that is faster, more convenient and flexible. Business owners must understand how crypto payments work and familiarize themselves with their advantages and limitations to accept BTC payments. Let us learn the most important insights that business owners need before accepting Bitcoin payments.\n\nEmbrace the technological leap and global adoption that awaits in the upcoming bull run of 2024-2025 with Crypto Bull Run Ready Career Path.\n\nAny business owner would prefer Bitcoin as a payment option to stay updated with the latest trends. The examples of popular brands which accept BTC as payment offer adequate reasons for business owners to accept crypto payments. Cryptocurrencies offer a trusted digital payment option without the need for physical ownership of money. Crypto payments have emerged as the most popular option for online service providers, virtual stores and ecommerce stores.\n\nAll crypto transactions rely on blockchain technology, which is a type of public ledger to record all types of transactions. Companies can accept crypto payments with the help of a Bitcoin payment gateway. Crypto payment gateways facilitate instant transactions between the crypto wallet of buyers and business owners. Buyers would have complete control of their assets and enjoy the benefits of decentralized payments with cheaper services.\n\nLearn the fundamentals, working principle and the future prospects of cryptocurrencies from Cryptocurrency Fudamentals Ebook\n\nCryptocurrencies and blockchain technology offer a new perspective on financial services for users, businesses and governments. Before you learn how to accept Bitcoin payments as a business, it is important to know the advantages of Bitcoin payments. Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency and any business which wants to adopt cryptocurrencies is likely to choose the top player. Here are some of the top reasons for which business owners should embrace Bitcoin payments.\n\nCompanies can choose Bitcoin as a trusted payment method for new and international customers. It can offer easier transactions with international customers without the need for humongous transaction charges. Businesses can use Bitcoin as an additional payment option that brings in more customers alongside improving customer experiences.\n\nThe common assumption about Bitcoin is that it might replace cash. Bitcoin is similar to cash in terms of finality of payment as Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. The benefits of Bitcoin payments can help business owners avoid payment disputes or chargebacks. Freedom from larger chargeback fees can help business owners save money for other critical requirements.\n\nBitcoin payments can help business owners save money on transaction processing. Business owners who rely on credit card payments must have to pay credit card processing fees that is a huge expense. Bitcoin can help business owners avoid such costs in transaction processing. It is important to remember that some crypto payment gateways would charge a fee of 1% on the transaction amount.\n\nWant to get an in-depth understanding of crypto fundamentals, trading and investing strategies?

It is also important to understand the limitations of Bitcoin payments to use them in the best way possible. Business owners must prepare for challenges such as keeping up with changes in crypto regulations and new technological advancements. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin creates another limitation in terms of accountability.\n\nBitcoin transactions are completely irreversible and you cannot ask for customer support to revert an accidental transaction. Business owners must also look out for the limitations of Bitcoin payments in the domain of fraud protection. It is also important to remember that Bitcoin still has a long way to go before achieving mainstream adoption. Most people would have to learn how to use cryptocurrencies and their technical aspects to pay with Bitcoin.\n\nAnother notable limitation that you must understand before choosing the best method to accept Bitcoin payments is network activity. Bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency and growing activity on the network creates delays in transaction processing. Therefore, business owners might have to wait for ten minutes or even hours for receiving payments from customers.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects!\n\nBusiness owners can use Bitcoin payments as a useful strategy to stay ahead in competitive market environments. The search for answers to queries like “how to accept Bitcoin payments as a business” may lead you to different options. The approach for accepting Bitcoin payments would differ according to the requirements and goals of your business. Here are some of the common steps you must follow to accept BTC payments as a business owner.\n\nThe first step to embrace Bitcoin payments in your business involves understanding regulations for Bitcoin in your area. You must learn about the important tax implications associated with Bitcoin transactions. Awareness of Bitcoin regulations can help you accept BTC as payment with a clear impression of restrictions imposed by law. Regulations can help business owners create the most productive plans for recording Bitcoin payments in their accounting workflows.\n\nThe next important step for accepting Bitcoin payments in your business involves setting up a crypto payment gateway. You can use a wallet for keeping the money you receive from customers and a payment gateway can exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies. Gateways offer the flexibility for converting Bitcoin to any fiat currency albeit with a transaction fee. The best way to understand a crypto payment gateway involves drawing similarities with payment processor gateways for credit cards.\n\nThe best method to accept Bitcoin payments involves the effective use of a payment gateway. You would need a gateway that helps you address the requirements in each step of crypto transactions for your business. The payment process starts with a transaction and the crypto payment gateway offers the option to pay with cryptocurrency. Customers can pay for the product or service with an amount equal to the fair market value of the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe crypto payment gateway helps in instant conversion of cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies of your choice. You can then add the money to your account with the gateway provider. The money would be deposited in the bank account you want according to the terms of the service contract. It is important to remember that you would have to pay service fees for the transactions.\n\nYou can accept Bitcoin payments only if you have configured your online store for the same. The process of setting up your store for accepting Bitcoin payments is extremely simple as you have to download an app or plugin on the ecommerce platform. Another promising option for adding Bitcoin payments to your online stores involves integration of payments with the help of HTML code from wallets.\n\nDifferent platforms and shopping channels used in online stores have unique solutions for accepting Bitcoin payments. PayPal offers the flexibility for accepting crypto payments with its checkout solution. On the other hand, ecommerce platforms such as Shopify and WordPress offer easy plugins for Bitcoin payments.\n\nOne of the most crucial requirements of accepting Bitcoin as payments for your business involves including them in accounting systems. You can accept Bitcoin payments as a business online when you can track all the payments you receive in Bitcoin. It is important to report your earnings in Bitcoin to authorities such as the IRS. You should set up the accounting system for recording payments to ensure a smoother tax season.\n\nIt is important to ensure that you document your Bitcoin payments in the same accounting system you use for other business transactions. You must integrate Bitcoin transactions with the existing accounting software used for your online store to avoid tax discrepancies.\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency and inherently volatile in terms of pricing. Business owners can capitalize on the benefits of Bitcoin payments only if they have the resilience to deal with massive fluctuations in pricing of Bitcoin. You should have the best measures in place for liquidity that enable immediate conversion of Bitcoin payments to cash.\n\nStart learning about Cryptocurrencies with World’s first Cryptocurrency Skill Path with quality resources tailored by industry experts Now!\n\nThe review of steps to accept Bitcoin payments as a business owner shows that you can stay ahead of the competition. Accepting Bitcoin as payments may paint your business as a leader in embracing new technological trends.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Facebook announced it was creating a blockchain group but with little in terms of details the industry has been left to speculate.\n\n",
    "content": "Facebook Inc. (FB) has set its sights on blockchain technology, recently announcing the creation of a new unit headed by one of its senior executives, David Marcus. But with little details as to what the social media giant has planned for the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies, the industry is left to speculate.\n\nFrom payments to privacy, the blockchain industry is abuzz wondering what Facebook has planned, according to the Financial Times . To get a sense of what could be going on industry watchers have turned to Marcus’ resume. At Facebook, he was in charge of Facebook Messenger for awhile and was also the president of PayPal. Marcus also sits on the board of Coinbase, the U.S. based cryptocurrency exchange. All of his current and previous roles have led to speculation that Facebook could be eyeing a payments product using blockchain. One idea being bandied about is that the social media giant will deploy blockchain to create its own cryptocurrency to enable payments on the platform.\n\nSheila Warren, head of blockchain at the World Economic Forum told the Financial Times Facebook could develop a digital token to enable micropayments on the social media platform. That could, in turn, result in a slew of new applications, she said. It would also be welcomed by publishers who want to get paid when Facebook users share and spread their content.\n\nBlockchain Can Prove A Facebook User\u0027s Identity\n\nOn the privacy and data fronts, experts told the paper Facebook could use blockchain technology to enhance privacy for the billions of people that are on its platform any given day. For instance, blockchain could be employed to prove a person’s identity and could be used to provide users with more control over their data. Facebook could create contracts that stipulate who can receive information on the platform. “One of the things blockchain is good at doing is creating trust where trust doesn’t exist,” Warren said in the report. “You set the permissions in such a way that if you say for cat videos, you can take all my data, but for music videos, you can only take my screen name, it is self-executed automatically.” She noted Facebook could also tap blockchain technology to create a public key to match a user’s private information. (See more: Which FAANG Will Win the Blockchain Wars? )Facebook Announced Blockchain Efforts Earlier In May\n\nEarlier this month Facebook announced it was creating a team to study how the blockchain technology behind bitcoin can be used in developing new products. “I\u0027m setting up a small group to explore how to best leverage blockchain across Facebook, starting from scratch,” Marcus said in a post on his personal Facebook page regarding on his departure from Messenger. Facebook, which recently banned ads related to cryptocurrency and initial coin offerings, has not said how it might use blockchain technology. The move could be to get out in front of the technology before rivals do. After all, Facebook is adept at crushing the competition, acquiring WhatsApp and Instagram. With blockchain, the company can’t purchase it but it can develop it.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Investors often confuse blockchain and Bitcoin. This confusion carries over into ETFs. How do blockchain ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs differ?\n\nBitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are relatively new, while the number of blockchain ETFs is growing. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have been embroiled in several regulatory battles and heavily scrutinized by government authorities. Blockchain technology is neither banned nor under heightened scrutiny by most regulatory agencies. Blockchain ETFs primarily track the stock market prices of companies invested in blockchain technology. The first Bitcoin futures ETFs began trading in 2021, and Bitcoin spot ETFs began trading in January 2024.\n\nWhen investing in any ETF, pay attention to the expense ratio, which is what you will pay in fees. Expense ratios reduce returns, so the lower the better.\n\nThe SEC approved the first bitcoin spot ETFs in January 2024, allowing these funds to directly hold bitcoin on behalf of their clients. In May 2024, the SEC also approved a rule change that would allow ETFs to hold the ether cryptocurrency on behalf of their clients as well.\n\n",
    "content": "Blockchain ETFs vs. Bitcoin ETFs: An Overview\n\nAs Bitcoin earned a stable place within the investment community, Bitcoin and blockchain-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also gained investor interest. The emergence of these ETFs allows access to a broader spectrum of investors wanting exposure to these digital assets without the complications of direct asset management.\n\nBlockchain ETFs—a type of exchange-traded product (ETP)—offer a more diversified exposure to the broader blockchain industry across sectors like finance, supply chain management, and healthcare that the technology is changing. Alternatively, Bitcoin ETFs are more focused, providing more direct exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin, the best-known cryptocurrency.\n\nThese funds either hold Bitcoin directly or track its price through futures contracts, giving investors a way to benefit from Bitcoin\u0027s price appreciation without storing the cryptocurrency themselves.\n\nDespite these differences, media reports frequently treat the terms \"Bitcoin\" and \"blockchain\" interchangeably. As a result, it\u0027s possible to confuse blockchain ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs, although they are different financial instruments.\n\nBlockchain ETFs\n\nBlockchain ETFs primarily track the stock prices of companies that have invested in blockchain technology in their fund, though they aren’t too focused on a specific cryptocurrency or entity. Blockchain is a technology not tied to a particular company or product.\n\n“Bitcoin needs blockchain, but blockchain doesn’t need Bitcoin,” said Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify ETFs, which says it’s the largest ETF focused on blockchain. The blockchain universe of investments is not restricted to a particular sector, such as IBM\u0027s blockchain relationships with the auto sector, wineries, and healthcare.\n\nOther firms whose shares are typically held by blockchain ETFs are Visa, which is exploring ways to use blockchain to restructure payment frictions, and Honeywell, a manufacturing company that uses blockchain for supply chain management.\n\nOn the technology front, Nvidia, the graphics processing units giant, provides hardware essential for cryptocurrency mining and blockchain operations and is a blockchain ETF mainstay.\n\nBitcoin ETFs\n\nMost Bitcoin ETFs approved by the SEC track the price of Bitcoin through futures contracts traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. In this model, ETFs follow the price of Bitcoin by owning futures contracts.\n\nIn October 2021, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) launched the first Bitcoin futures ETF, tracking Bitcoin futures contracts pegged to the future price of the cryptocurrency.\n\nSince then, several other funds have launched to expose investors to the Bitcoin market without direct ownership of the currency, including the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF), and the Simplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Income ETF (MAXI).\n\nSome funds focus on different crypto-related strategies. ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF (BITI) allows investors to short Bitcoin, thus profiting from a decline rather than a rise in Bitcoin prices. Other ETFs invest in blockchain companies and Bitcoin futures, such as the Global X Blockchain and Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS), which blurs the line between these ETFs.\n\nFor many years, U.S. regulators rejected proposals for funds that hold Bitcoins directly, citing worries over the potential for fraud and market manipulation. The regulator also raised these concerns about Tether and other stablecoins.\n\nHowever, the SEC eventually relented in 2023, after a federal appeals court ruled that the regulator had provided insufficient justification for rejecting the ETF applications by the asset manager Grayscale Investments. After the ruling, the SEC approved the first Bitcoin spot ETFs, 11 of them, which began trading in January 2024.\n\nKey Differences\n\nUnderstanding the difference between Bitcoin ETFs and blockchain ETFs means knowing the difference between the instruments they track. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, while a blockchain is the underlying database technology. This distinction is significant when considered within the context of investment instruments.\n\nEven though Bitcoin futures were already offered on the U.S.’s major exchanges, cryptocurrency’s regulatory status remains unclear in some jurisdictions. As adoption increased, virtual currencies have been embroiled in several regulatory battles for their role in criminal activities, such as money laundering.\n\nAlternatively, blockchain technology has won the interest of major companies in the world of legacy finance, including JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co. and Visa. Blockchain technology is neither banned nor under scrutiny by regulatory agencies. Blockchain ETFs are also relatively stable compared with the volatility of Bitcoin since they are not exposed to Bitcoin’s price swings.\n\nThat said, blockchain is still considered a nascent technology. As such, the stock prices of companies tracked by the ETF are more susceptible to factors that do not affect blockchain technology. Bitcoin ETFs are also affected by regulations on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere are 26 blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs trading in U.S. markets, according to the ETF Database. As of May 24, 2024, these ETFs have a combined worth of just over $60 billion in assets under management (AUM), and their expense ratios range from 0.3% to 2.5%.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAs the popularity of Bitcoin continues to grow, so have Bitcoin ETFs. In general, digital currencies are mainstream with institutional investors. Many details are appealing about a cryptocurrency ETF—investors would be able to buy and sell Bitcoin more easily and eliminate the inconvenience of securing and storing Bitcoin.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

    "content": "Bitcoin mining behemoth, Marathon Digital has made headlines by investing a staggering $100 million in BTC. This substantial investment comes despite BTC’s previous price drops, underscoring the mining giant’s confidence in the long term potential of the pioneer cryptocurrency.\n\nIn a press release published on Thursday, July 25, MARA, (recently rebranded from Marathon Digital) announced that it has purchased an additional $100 million worth of BTC. This substantial Bitcoin investment marks a significant increase in MARA’s already impressive Bitcoin holdings.\n\nMARA’s latest BTC acquisition has brought its balance sheet holdings to about 20,000 BTC, valued at approximately $1.3 billion. The Bitcoin mining company’s total holdings now represent nearly 0.1% of BTC’s maximum supply of 21 million BTC.\n\nNotably, MARA’s substantial BTC purchase comes at a time when the crypto market is steadily recovering from previous bearish declines. Despite the constant fluctuations in BTC’s price, MARA has taken advantage of recent declines to heavily invest in Bitcoin in order to facilitate its long term view of the crypto assets potential.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of BTC is trading at $68,031, marking a 1.4% increase in the last 24 hours and another 2.24% surge over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. Based on current exchange rates and MARA’s balance sheet holdings, it could be estimated that its recent acquisition totaled about 1,500 BTC.\n\nWhile MARA has not disclosed the specific average price at which it acquired the $100 million worth of BTC, the Bitcoin mining giant announced that it will be adopting a full Hold On For Dear Life (HODL) approach towards its Bitcoin treasury policy.\n\nFurthermore, Michael Saylor, co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of MicroStrategy, has commemorated MARA’s latest Bitcoin purchase and its 20,000 BTC milestone. The popular Bitcoin billionaire has urged Marathon Digital to increase their holdings to 26,200 BTC, cleverly referencing the standard marathon distance of 26.2 miles.\n\nMARA also announced its decision to adopt a full HODL strategy for its Bitcoin treasury, aiming to retain all the BTC mined during operations instead of selling it. Additionally, the company revealed that it will be periodically making strategic open market purchases to further increase its considerable holdings.\n\nFred Thiel, MARA’s chairman and CEO, emphasized the company’s strong belief in BTC’s long-term value, encouraging governments and corporations to consider BTC as a reserve asset. He elaborated that MARA sees Bitcoin as the best treasury reserve asset globally and supports the idea of sovereign wealth funds holding the pioneer cryptocurrency.\n\nAdditionally, Salman Khan, MARA’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), revealed that the Bitcoin mining firm once held all of its Bitcoin. However due to recent market conditions, increased institutional interest and improving macro environment, MARA has decided to return a full HODL strategy.\n\n",

    "title": "Why William Hinman`s Emails Matter to the XRP Army and the Crypto’s Price",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Recently released emails from former SEC director William Hinman have rallied the XRP troops, but the documents are not a smoking gun.\n\n",
    "content": "On June 13, 2023, documents tied to William Hinman, the former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Division of Corporation Finance from 2017 to 2020, were released to the public in connection with the SEC\u0027s lawsuit against Ripple, briefly sending the price of the XRP token up 7.4% as optimism spread that Ripple would win their ongoing case.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nVery broadly, Ripple and its partisans have argued that the Hinman emails could reveal a biased or flawed process behind the decision to publicly suggest in a 2018 speech by Hinman that Ethereum (ETH) may not be a security. One smoking gun might have been some sort of display of bias against Ripple and XRP, but the released emails do not mention either directly.\n\nRipple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty argued after the release that the emails showed Hinman ignoring warnings from colleagues that his speech was not grounded in law and created confusion about securities designations. At the very least, Alderoy seems to be suggesting Ripple has been treated unfairly by regulators.\n\nEarly analysis of the emails does not seem to have found a major win for Ripple Labs, however. After a short rally on the morning of the emails’ release, XRP retraced its price and headed even lower, which may reflect some disappointment on this front.\n\nAhead of the documents’ release, Ripple and XRP supporters had been focused on statements by Hinman suggesting that a token isn’t a security if it is “sufficiently decentralized.” That metric seems to have been used to justify a public carveout for Ethereum, but, at least according to feedback given to Hinman by other SEC staff and officials, was not grounded in existing securities regulation. Ripple has argued that XRP, like Ethereum, is “sufficiently decentralized” and should not be classified as a security according to the standards laid out by Hinman.\n\nCritics have long argued, however, that the underlying claim that Ethereum and XRP are comparably decentralized is itself highly debatable. Most significantly, there has now been close to a decade of debate and litigation over whether Ripple itself should be considered the creator of the XRP ledger and issuer of the XRP token – and therefore the issuer and seller of an unregistered security.\n\nRipple Labs allies generally characterize the company as separate from XRP. In particular, they have argued that the XRP blockchain was created by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen, working as OpenCoin, before an entity called “Ripple” even existed. But OpenCoin became Ripple Labs and what is today simply called Ripple, and those cofounders “gifted” 80 billion XRP, 80% of the total supply, to Ripple Labs. Over the years, Ripple has made a variety of branding and messaging changes to represent that they are not the creators of XRP. That includes changing the preferred way to discuss the token itself, which for many years was commonly referred to as “Ripple.”\n\nRead More: What Is Ripple and the XRP Cryptocurrency?\n\nTo critics such as Preston Byrne, this looks like an orchestrated deception, and one of the earliest instances of “decentralization theater.” And if XRP was effectively created or issued by Ripple, the parallel to Ethereum breaks down quickly, since Ethereum has no corporate for-profit parent. This could be a more compelling explanation for the different regulatory treatment of the two chains than bias or procedural failures.\n\nIn any case, however the case develops and is ultimately decided, whenever new information is released that supporters believe bolsters or hurts Ripple\u0027s side of the case, XRP\u0027s price generally moves in parallel with the positive or negative sentiment.\n\nSee Also: Ripple Does Not Care Whether XRP Is “Sufficiently Decentralized”\n\n",

    "summary": "The largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has recovered to trade in the $66,000 to $68,000 range despite the start of Mt. Gox creditor repayments. \n\n",
    "content": "Amid the recent recovery from a significant price correction of over 25% that sent the Bitcoin price to a 6-month low of $53,500, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has since recovered to trade in the $66,000 to $68,000 range despite the start of Mt. Gox creditor repayments.\n\nInvestors, buoyed by prospects of continued price appreciation, have adopted a HODL stance, opting to retain their assets rather than selling them off following the alleged hack suffered by the Bitcoin exchange in 2011.\n\nData from market intelligence platform Arkham reveals that Mt. Gox initiated a significant movement of $2.47 billion worth of BTC to new wallets, facilitating the distribution of 5,106 BTC worth $335 million to four distinct Bitstamp addresses on Wednesday.\n\nConcurrently, creditors have commenced receiving their owed Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) through the US-based crypto exchange Kraken, as previously reported by NewsBTC on Thursday.\n\nDespite initial concerns of a sell-off akin to the June events, where the German police’s wallet sold over $3 billion in BTC, impacting Bitcoin’s market performance, analytics from CryptoQuant indicate a positive shift.\n\nA notable increase in Bitcoin withdrawals from Kraken post-Mt. Gox reimbursements suggest that affected users opt to hold onto their coins, moving them from exchanges to cold wallets.\n\nOn-chain data compiled by the firm shows that in the past 24 hours alone, more than 5,000 BTC worth $329 million have been withdrawn from exchanges, contributing to the current consolidation price action and stability for the Bitcoin price over the past few days.\n\nArkham’s data further illustrates Mt. Gox’s ongoing efforts to repay creditors, with over 50,000 BTC transferred from the exchange’s wallet out of a maximum of 142,000 BTC while retaining 90,344 BTC valued at approximately $6 billion in BTC.\n\nEchoing the sentiment of CryptoQuant’s findings, Alex Thorn from Galaxy Digital highlights that most creditors are long-term Bitcoin proponents with a profound understanding of the technology.\n\nThorn asserts that their preference to reclaim Bitcoin rather than opt for a USD payout signifies a strong inclination towards holding their assets rather than triggering a sell-off. Moreover, Thorn points out that the substantial capital gains implications of selling Bitcoin could dissuade creditors from liquidating their holdings.\n\nAt the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at the $66,400 milestone, as it is a key support level for the Bitcoin price on its way to retesting the upper resistance walls with an eye on the all-time high of $73,700 reached on March 14th.\n\nAdding to the bullish sentiment surrounding BTC’s price performance over the past week, the price may find notable support levels that could prevent further declines in the event of a sell-off by some Mt. Gox creditors in the coming days at $65,000.\n\nAnother key level for the bulls to watch is the $63,500 area, where the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) is located, which, as seen in the daily BTC/USDT chart below, has previously accompanied the price on further gains and acted as a strong support for BTC.\n\nUltimately, it remains to be seen what stance creditors of the failed Mt. Gox exchange will take in the coming days and weeks as more repayments are expected to flood creditors’ wallets and what impact this may have on the price\n\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "South Korea’s willingness to embrace blockchain seems to be fully backed by the government’s actions and statements.\n\n",
    "content": "The past few months have seen a flood of stories about South Korea’s recent push for the blockchain industry within its borders. As one of the countries most actively involved in the sector’s regulation and oversight, South Korea has become a leader in terms of embracing the young technology and is instrumental in the crypto industry’s ongoing boom. A recent report that the government has earmarked over $4 billion to invest in a variety of distributed ledgers and administrative applications of blockchain technology only cements that view. Even so, this is not the first news that shows South Korea’s commitment to blockchain, though it does highlight the degree to which the country has dived in.\n\nIt is worth wondering, though, what has changed in the relatively short time since the South Korean government announced a ban on ICOs and possible ban on cryptocurrencies as a whole. It isn’t just the backlash that made authorities shift course. In reality, South Korea has never been bearish on the technology, and its ban on ICOs was likely motivated more by the staggering number of scams showing up in the news than fears of the technology itself. Tracing the steps from this negative view to South Korea\u0027s later status as a haven for blockchain illuminates the country’s optimism for the technology.\n\n“South Korea’s culture, fast-paced digital affinity and politics make it the ideal combination for adopting an optimistic approach towards blockchain technology. Less of speculation but more of genuine interest in technology and real world adoption is reinforcing the overall motivation within the space,” said John Kirch, Chief Evangelist of Sentinel Protocol.\n\nMore than Surface Level Commitment\n\nAt first glance, the commitment to invest such a large sum into distributed ledger technology and other innovative tech fields may seem like an abrupt change of heart in South Korea. A little digging, however, shows that this is just the latest in a series of moves by the government to become a true haven for blockchain.\n\nThe country already has a reputation as a major player in the world’s tech industry, but 2018 has seen the government turn its attention to the crypto sector. South Korean exchanges like Bitthumb and CoinOne, both of which rank among the top 100 cryptocurrency exchanges by trade volume, have become major hubs for trading.\n\nThis comes with the South Korean government\u0027s increasingly favorable view of blockchain, which is doing its part to spur business growth. Regulators have been proactive in creating a safer space for cryptos. Officials recently announced that exchanges will be classified as financial institutions (bringing them under the government’s regulatory purview) and have discussed fully lifting the ICO ban.\n\nThe government has also revealed the creation of a new office named the Financial Innovation Bureau which will oversee emerging financial technology—including blockchain and cryptocurrency—to create more forward-looking policies and platforms for supporting innovation. The South Korean National Assembly has even discussed plans to create their own “blockchain island”—a special zone for blockchain with more friendly regulations and policies.\n\nOptimism Driven by Innovation\n\nThe drive by the government has run parallel to the explosion of innovation the local blockchain sector has seen in the past year. Several major events—many of them sponsored by the government—as well as intriguing projects have caught the eye of industry observers worldwide. These projects have tackled everything from key problems in the industry itself to major corporate pain points.\n\nSentinel Protocol, for instance, was born from CEO Patrick Kim’s own experience with blockchain-based fraud. The company has released a free Google Chrome extension that lets users validate the ICOs they wish to invest in by, ironically, using the power of blockchain to combat the issues the technology has inherently built in. Sentinel’s hope is to reduce ICO scams and fraud significantly, and lead to a more open and friendly ecosystem.\n\nOthers, like ICON, are looking to create a more transparent and efficient blockchain network. The company is already the largest blockchain in Korea and has shown applications in several industries and fields. Lucidity is an interesting US Company backed by some Korean investing with far-reaching potential, as it deals with transparency in the digital advertising and analytics field. The company has recognition worldwide and has even won industry awards for its services.\n\nMore important than a startup hub, however, is the establishment of South Korea as a center for conversation and innovation around blockchain—a development highlighted in the several major blockchain events planned and occurring in the country. These also feature some of the most prominent names in several fields surrounding technology.\n\nBlock Seoul, for example, an upcoming major blockchain conference, is set to have several high-profile speakers in attendance. Michael Hayden, the former head of the CIA and the NSA, and James Clapper, the Obama administration’s Director of U.S. National Intelligence, are both slated to appear along with several business figures. The inclusion of these two security-oriented names highlights the importance of security and government embrace for blockchain’s future. As governments better understand the true implications of blockchain, the technology should see greater adoption and embrace by regulators.\n\nAs recently as July, the country also hosted Korea Blockchain Week, which included several major events and doubled as a gathering of many of the industry’s luminaries. Additionally, the South Korean government has noted that it will continue sponsoring the sector and providing more opportunities to attract new businesses and ideas in the sphere.\n\nWords Backed By Actions\n\nMore than just a show, South Korea’s willingness to embrace blockchain seems to be fully backed by the government’s actions and statements. The country has wisely positioned itself at the crest of the blockchain wave, and it is creating policies that will make it a leader in the way governments cooperate with this burgeoning sector. By doing so, Korea has guaranteed that it will continue to hold its place among the world’s most innovative countries, and that it will have an important say in how the world interacts with blockchain.\n\n",

    "content": "Indeed, the Bitcoin price has been on a hot streak in recent weeks, returning to its past heights most investors have become accustomed to. However, the past week was a somewhat quiet one for the premier cryptocurrency, as it was for most of the digital asset market.\n\nInterestingly, the latest on-chain insights suggest that the crypto market, specifically the Bitcoin market, might not be inactive for too long.\n\nIn a recent post on the X platform, popular crypto pundit Ali Martinez revealed that Bitcoin miner capitulation has seemingly come to an end. This on-chain observation is based on a shift in the Glassnode Hash Ribbon indicator, which measures BTC’s hash rate.\n\nTypically, the Hash Ribbon features two moving averages; including the short-term (30-day) and long-term (60-day) hash rate. A cross of the short-term moving average below the long-term moving average implies miner capitulation, which is characterized by widespread sell-offs by miners.\n\nOn the other hand, when the 60-day ribbon falls under the 30-day ribbon, it indicates the end of capitulation and the potential start of a recovery phase for the network. As shown in the chart below, this positive cross appears to be the current situation for Bitcoin, signaling an optimistic future for the flagship cryptocurrency.\n\nUltimately, this means that Bitcoin miners are returning to the network and restarting operations, as they become more profitable. From a historical standpoint, the end of miner capitulation is a bullish sign, as it often precedes significant price leaps for the premier cryptocurrency. Martinez highlighted this in his post on X, saying “this could present good buying opportunities.”\n\nAnother indicator that supports this on-chain revelation is the Bitcoin Miner Profit/Loss Sustainability metric, which measures how fair miner revenues are. According to the latest data from CryptoQuant, the BTC miners have been making some profit over the past few days, putting them in the fairly paid region of the indicator.\n\nAs of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $68,230, reflecting a mere 0.7% increase in the last 24 hours. As earlier inferred, the premier cryptocurrency had an uneventful week in terms of price action, dancing between the $64,000 and $68,000 range.\n\nAccording to data from CoinGecko, the BTC price increased by barely 1% in the past week. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency retained its position as the largest digital asset in the sector, with a market capitalization of more than $1.33 trillion.\n\n",

    "content": "In the blockchain environment terms such as latency and throughput are frequently used. The realm has undergone unprecedented change in the last few years. Latency refers to the time that passes between the submission of a transaction and its finalization within a blockchain network. Throughput, on the other hand, means the transactions per second that can be processed by a blockchain network. The comprehension of both blockchain latency and throughput is essential to understand how blockchain networks work.\n\nBlockchain latency and throughput are two important metrics that must be taken into account while measuring blockchain systems. Latency in blockchain is the first thing to keep in mind since it sheds light on transaction validity. The next thing is the throughput of the system. It gives a glimpse into the total load that can be handled by a blockchain system, per unit of time. Let us explore the role of latency and throughput in blockchain networks.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nFinding an answer to the question – “What is blockchain latency and throughput?” is pivotal to learn about blockchain systems. In a blockchain network, latency and throughput serve as key performance indicators. By measuring throughput and latency in blockchain it is possible to uncover data transmission and processing aspects in embedded systems and blockchain.\n\nLatency in blockchain is the turnaround time between issuing a valid transaction within the blockchain network and its confirmation. Hence, from the point of view of customers it refers to the speed of the service. The shorter the time that is taken between two events, the better it is for blockchain users. Latency is an important factor that can enable blockchain technology to gain traction among users. The purpose should be to reduce latency so that the frustration that the average customer feels can be kept under check.\n\nThroughput is the second key concept that one has to grasp in order to measure blockchain systems. The throughput is typically expressed in terms of transactions per second (TPS). It is an important aspect, especially for blockchain system designers. You can ascertain whether a blockchain system is reliable and efficient or not by measuring throughput and latency in blockchain. However, you must bear in mind that although both serve as important indicators, they are different from each other. This is because there exists a difference between latency and throughput in blockchain.\n\nGet familiar with the terms related to blockchain with Blockchain Basics Flashcards.\n\nThe use of the terms blockchain latency and throughput is common in the realm of blockchain. By focusing on these metrics, it is possible to understand how they contribute to the reliability and promptness of blockchain systems. But you also need to understand the difference between latency and throughput in blockchain.\n\nA common difference between them is that for measuring throughput you must focus on transactions per second. On the other hand, the measurement of latency in blockchain is possible in seconds. Thus, latency helps measuring how fast the confirmation of an individual is possible, whereas throughput helps measuring the total rate of translation over time.\n\nWhen there exists intense competition, throughput remains constant. However, it is possible to change latency by simply altering the load. As when there is a rise in the load, the wait queue for customers will certainly get longer. When there is a lack of contention, the latency remains constant, but it is possible to alter the throughput by changing the load on the blockchain system. This is possible because in the case of low contention, the queue latency is zero and the minimum overhead relating to sending a transaction remains fixed.\n\nBy focusing on the use cases you can understand the key differences between the network metrics. For example, when blockchain is used in the finance domain, low latency is key to ensure instant and real-time settlements. Similarly, high throughput is fundamental to support a large number of financial transactions during peak times.\n\n\n\nIn order to address the question – “What is blockchain latency and throughput?” comprehensively you must become familiar with the associated factors. That’s right! A number of factors come into play that impact blockchain latency and throughput. The below variables can impact the metrics and the performance of blockchain systems:\n\nUndoubtedly, the consensus mechanism is among the most important factors impacting latency and throughput in the blockchain. Blockchain networks have to go through consensus algorithms. It is an important step to ensure the verification of transactions. Furthermore, this mechanism supports network accuracy by preventing any kind of data manipulation. The inclusion of consensus protocols increases latency by slowing down the network.\n\nIn the case of public blockchains, typically a maximum block size may be set. This step is taken to enhance platform security while restricting the rates of transaction processing. It is a key variable that can impact.\n\nThe network that carries out block level consensus needs a high level of bandwidth. Such a requirement is vital so that it can support proper distribution as well as processing of transactions. The slowest performing node factor can have a negative impact on blockchain latency and throughput. Diverse use cases of blockchain latency and throughput may have varying bandwidth requirements that may impact blockchain network performance.\n\nWithin blockchain networks congestion may occur when more transactions are sent than it is capable of handling. It is a common issue that may arise when a greater number of participants engage in transactions within blockchain networks. By reducing network congestion, it is possible to reduce latency in blockchain networks. Otherwise, it can lead to higher transaction costs and increase the waiting time for customers.\n\nThe elements that have been identified can have a significant impact. As a result, these variables can impact how blockchain networks and systems perform. While measuring them in blockchain, you must focus on these aspects. It can help to take appropriate measures to boost the performance of blockchain networks.\n\nStart learning Blockchain with World’s first Blockchain Skill Paths with quality resources tailored by industry experts Now!\n\nThe measurement of blockchain performance is a fundamental step. In fact, by measuring blockchain performance it is possible to enhance their scalability. Now that you already know the answer to ‘What is blockchain latency and throughput?’ you know they can impact blockchain performance. You need to measure latency and throughput to uncover the performance of blockchain networks.\n\nIn recent years the application of blockchain technology is expanding to different areas such as finance, healthcare, supply chain management and many more. This trend has further magnified the need to not only measure blockchain performance but also take steps to improve it.\n\nYou need to measure it to identify whether a blockchain network is able to perform efficiently or not. For doing so it is imperative to know the difference between latency and throughput in blockchain. It is undoubtedly a critical step that can help you measure blockchain performance in detail.\n\nNow you already know that both latency and throughput are key to shape the performance of blockchain networks. You need to keep a tab on these performance metrics in order to boost the performance of blockchain systems. As the popularity as well as adoption of blockchain technology is increasing, it is a must to prioritize its performance and efficiency. Measuring latency and throughput is the fundamental step to gain valuable insights into the health of blockchain networks.\n\nYou should measure blockchain latency and throughput to identify performance gaps. By taking into account real-life use cases of blockchain latency and throughput, one can understand the need to lower latency and increase throughput. Furthermore, it is essential to take into consideration the important factors that can impact these performance metrics.\n\nWhether you are new or experienced in the domain of blockchain, it is a must to familiarize yourself with latency and throughput. It is because these act as the chief metrics that help in measuring the performance of blockchain networks. As a customer you will obviously want the latency to be low as it can reduce your waiting time by ensuring that the confirmation of your transaction can be done quickly. Similarly, a high throughput will imply that a greater number of transactions can be processed by a blockchain network in a second.\n\nStart learning Blockchain with World’s first Blockchain Career Paths with quality resources tailored by industry experts Now!\n\nIn blockchain technology, both latency and throughput act as indispensable components. These are the metrics that one can use in order to evaluate the performance of blockchain networks and systems. As the adoption of blockchain is on the rise, it is necessary to keep a tab on its performance.\n\nBy measuring latency, it is possible to measure the time that passes between the submission of a transaction and its confirmation or finalization. Similarly, by measuring throughput, one can get an insight into the number of transactions that can be processed within a second. These two elements can serve as important indicators that help to enhance blockchain network performance.\n\n\n\n",

This decision was not made lightly, and we believe it is the right course of action,\" the email said.\n\nWeeks ago, a federal judge allowed a class action lawsuit against DraftKings to proceed after finding plaintiffs \"plausibly pled\" DraftKings\u0027 NFTs were unregistered securities, according to Westlaw.\n\nDraftKings entered the NFT business in mid-2021 after noticing its \"golden\" customers were embracing digital collectibles from NBA Top Shot and other projects, co-founder Matt Kalish said last year in a podcast from Ark Invest.\n\nBuilt around an in-house marketplace, DraftKings\u0027 NFT business \"let us play in this space that could become, in the next couple of decades, gigantic,\" Kalish said on the podcast. The company hired blockchain engineers, built its tech atop Polygon network, and started with a Tom Brady-themed collection that quickly sold out.\n\nThough collectors\u0027 appetite for plain Jane NFTs had fizzled by 2022, DraftKings stuck with web3 via Reignmakers: a fantasy sports game powered by NFTs. On the Ark podcast Kalish said it captured all the things DraftKings customers loved, from day-trading to fantasy gaming.\n\n\"We were really looking to build the best utility-driven, NFT product out there, and we saw some really great momentum\" in the first few months, Kalish said on the podcast. Its internal sales figures convinced DraftKings to expand from Football to UFC and PGA.\n\nThis year, DraftKings started getting hit with class action lawsuits alleging its NFT sales violated securities laws, a charge other sports-themed NFT companies had also grappled with. In June, NBA Top Shot settled its own legal snafu with a $4 million payout.\n\nThe class action against DraftKings appears to be headed to trial, according to court records.\n\nAs part of the NFT shutdown DraftKings is offering buyouts to Reignmakers players, the email said.

    "content": "Blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, has enormous promise but also major security vulnerabilities that could lead to billions of dollars in losses. Chief among these vulnerabilities are the very advantages touted among blockchain proponents: transparency, distributed control and anonymity.\n\nStuart Madnick, a professor of information technologies at the MIT Sloan School of Management, studied 72 cases of blockchain system security breaches from 2011 to 2018 totaling $1 billion. Some of the cases were small losses of about $12,000, but others cost companies as much as $600 million.﻿﻿Common among the cases were the attack vectors. Criminals have used blockchain\u0027s features such transparency, distributed control and anonymity to steal millions.\n\n\"The bottom line is that while the blockchain system represents advances in encryption and security, it is vulnerable in some of the same ways as other technology, as well as having new vulnerabilities unique to blockchain,\" Madnick says.﻿﻿Distributed Ledger Technology Far from ‘Unbreakable’\n\nProponents of the distributed ledger technology tout its transparency, distributed control and anonymity. That being said, while blockchain offers advances in encryption and security, there are many issues with the technology, which is far from \"unbreakable.\"While Madnick examined 72 publicly reported security breaches, he says there are likely more, as many cyber attacks are not publicly reported.\n\n\"Blockchain may be its own worst enemy, as many of the things that make it so great also increase its vulnerability when it comes to security,\" Madnick says. \"Three examples include transparency, distributed control and anonymity.\"﻿﻿As for transparency, given the blockchain ledger and software code is copied on many servers and viewable by many, it leaves room for a criminal to access and study the code for weaknesses. The distributed nature of the technology, for which there is no on/off switch from a central computer, means it is difficult to stop an intruder from siphoning away money if a vulnerability is found.\n\nAdditionally, the anonymity offered to blockchain users, who receive a \"blockchain key\" comprised of long numbers, poses a threat. Although the number is impossible to guess and therefore has security benefits, Madnick noted there is \"no override capability on your blockchain account.\" Therefore, if you lose your key, you lose your funds. Madnick pointed to the case of a CEO of a cryptocurrency exchange who mysteriously died, taking millions of customers funds with him to the grave.﻿﻿Looking Ahead\n\nThough Madnick highlights known issues with blockchain, the technology\u0027s champions remain confident blockchain will prove itself in the long-run, revolutionizing the tech world much like the internet did beginning in the 1990s. And as potential vulnerabilities become more commonly known, steps can be taken to mitigate them.\n\n",

    "content": "Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) is working on a blockchain-related technology that is aimed at supporting cloud business, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nBlockchain- based services have enabled numerous startups to offer novel online services, assuring customers that their information is more secure and more efficiently managed compared to the traditional methods of online data hosting. Such new offerings are proving to be a tough competitor for various technology companies, especially the ones operating in the hosted solutions space, like the cloud-based data storage.\n\nWhy is Google Working on Blockchain?\n\nDigital ledgers like blockchain allow the secure recording of transactions and processing of data points over the Internet or other private networks. Because they are more secure and efficient in storing and retrieving key business data and content, businesses are increasingly moving to digital ledgers and blockchains.\n\nAdditionally, businesses are also wary of the risk of having only a single company host their key business data. The decentralized nature of blockchain is preferred by such businesses for better security and risk management of their content.\n\nWith a growing number of online services now available on the blockchain platform, it poses a natural threat to the traditional internet-based businesses. Technology giants like Google are taking an inclusive approach to fend off such competition. If you can’t beat them, join them!Google is said to be venturing into the blockchain space to complement its cloud business, as it faces stiff competition not only from other cloud providers, like Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN), but also from the many other new-age blockchain service providers. (For more, see How Amazon Competes With Google.)“The Alphabet Inc. unit is developing its own distributed digital ledger that third parties can use to post and verify transactions,” according to a person familiar with the matter quoted by Bloomberg.\n\nThe company is also expected to offer a white-label version of its distributed digital ledger. White labeling is the practice allowing of a developer or manufacturer allowing other companies to rebrand a product or service as their own.\n\nWith such white-label offerings, Google, which is known to host all of a client’s data on its own servers and data centers, may also be open to offering private blockchains. These private blockchains may be completely owned, controlled, and operated by the clients, either over the various servers spread throughout the Internet or hosted securely on a private network. (for more, see Public vs Private Blockchains: Challenges and Gaps.)Google Actively Pursuing Blockchain\n\nBlockchain has been on Google’s radar for a long time, as it comes as a natural extension to its cloud-based services.\n\nThe same source also mentions Google\u0027s recent acquisition and investment spree in startups with blockchain expertise.\n\nThough many of these unannounced deals remain outside of public knowledge, a CB Insight report ranks Google in the second place in the list of most active corporate investors in the blockchain space between 2012 and 2017. SBI Holdings takes the top spot, while Overstock.com Inc (OSTK), Citigroup Inc (C), and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) rank behind Google. Google has also hired many blockchain experts.\n\n“Like many new technologies, we have individuals in various teams exploring potential uses of blockchain but it’s way too early for us to speculate about any possible uses or plans,” a Google spokesman told Bloomberg.\n\nThere are also hints that Google may come out with an enhanced version of blockchain. Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google’s advertising chief, said at a recent conference that his division has a \"small team\" looking at blockchain, but noted the existing core technology can’t handle a lot of transactions quickly.\n\nOver the last decade, the blockchain market has grown rather slowly. However, it is poised to surge ahead rapidly over the next few years. From an estimated value of $706 million as of 2017, the blockchain market is expected to grow phenomenally and reach $60 billion worldwide as it creates new digital economic infrastructure, according to WinterGreen Research.\n\nTechnology giants like IBM Corp (IBM), Microsoft, and Accenture PLC (ACN), are currently leading the pack of blockchain service providers. With Amazon already offering services to build blockchain applications, and Facebook Inc’s (FB) founder Mark Zuckerberg also expressing interest in virtual tokens, encryption and other decentralized technology, Google seems all set to get into the blockchain game.\n\n",

    "content": "Machine learning has been one of the most complex disciplines in the domain of technology. Interestingly, it is easier to deploy machine learning models with tools like TensorFlow by Google. The tech giant released the open-source framework in November 2015 and revolutionized the AI landscape. The use of TensorFlow in neural network training, general numerical calculations, and deep learning on CPUs and GPUs has elevated the standards of AI systems.\n\nTensorFlow hosts an open-source community that includes developers, data engineers, and data scientists who contribute to the TensorFlow repository. As of now, it is the most popular AI framework, and it has promising potential for neural network training. Let us learn more about the fundamentals of TensorFlow, its working mechanism, and use cases, as well as discover how you can use it in neural networks.\n\n\n\nThe best approach to understanding how TensorFlow neural network code is better than with other frameworks is to learn its definition. It is an open-source library tailored for large-scale machine learning, numerical computation, and deep learning. TensorFlow also supports other predictive analytics and statistical workloads. With TensorFlow, the process of data collection, drawing predictions at scale, and optimizing future outcomes becomes easier. As a result, developers can make the most of TensorFlow for faster and easier implementation of machine learning models.\n\nThe capabilities of TensorFlow help in training and running deep learning networks for different tasks such as image recognition, NLP, handwritten digit classification, and word embeddings. You can add the code in its software libraries to any application and help it in learning the tasks. Any TensorFlow neural network example would operate on conventional CPUs or high-performance GPUs. On top of that, TensorFlow also leverages the tensor processing units or TPUs, which are tailored specifically for accelerating TensorFlow jobs.\n\nThe ability of TensorFlow to handle neural network workloads depends on their working mechanism. You can find three distinct elements in the TensorFlow workflow such as,\n\nYou can find the answers to “Why TensorFlow is used in CNN?” with a detailed explanation of its unique architecture. The framework takes in data in the form of a multidimensional array or tensors and then follows an execution process in two different ways. The first method involves development of a computational graph to define the data flow for training a model.\n\nOn the other hand, you can choose a more intuitive method with eager execution that relies on imperative programming principles. The eager execution approach also ensures faster assessment of operations. The TensorFlow architecture helps implement the training process on a desktop or a data center according to your needs. It is important to note that using tensors on the GPU can help accelerate the training process.\n\nAnother important aspect of the working mechanism of TensorFlow refers to the broad range of supporting features. For example, the TensorFlow neural network playground allows you to tinker with a neural network without any obligations. You can also access the TensorBoard to visually monitor the training process and the underlying computational graphs and evaluate model performance. You can also rely on Keras, the high-level API running on top of TensorFlow, to build models for general use cases. It can help you translate your ideas for a neural network into results faster than possible.\n\nWant to understand the importance of ethics in AI, ethical frameworks, principles, and challenges? Enroll now in Ethics Of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Course!\n\nYou might wonder why you should focus on TensorFlow for neural network training when you can choose other alternatives. The applications of TensorFlow in neural network training have more credibility due to the proven and tested business use cases of the framework. For example, Airbus uses TensorFlow to extract and analyze information sourced from satellite images to obtain valuable real-time insights for clients.\n\nPayPal has leveraged TensorFlow for generative modeling and deep transfer learning to enable faster recognition of complex fraud patterns with temporary variations. Social media giant Twitter has also utilized TensorFlow to create the Ranked Timeline, which ensures that users catch up with important tweets while following other users.\n\nIdentify new ways to leverage the full potential of generative AI in business use cases and become an expert in generative AI technologies with Generative AI Skill Path\n\nSpeaking of the advantages associated with TensorFlow, it is important to reflect on the significance of their neural network playground. The TensorFlow neural network playground is an ideal platform for making neural networks more accessible to users and for easier learning capabilities. Anyone can use the neural network playground in any way while ensuring compliance with the Apache License. You can find different types of controls that help you customize the playground for a specific lesson or topic.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of the neural network playground is the use of colors in the visualization. For example, you can find orange and blue in the visualizations in different ways. The general assumption about orange is that it indicates negative values, and blue indicates positive values. You can find data points in the form of small circles that are initially colored in orange or blue.\n\nYou would also note that the hidden layers have lines colored according to weights of connections between the neurons. Blue represents positive weight and suggests that the network uses the output of the neuron as specified. On the other hand, orange lines suggest that the network has assigned a negative weight.\n\nThe output layer has different dots that are orange or blue, according to the original values. The background color in the playground visualization shows the prediction of the network for a specific area. On top of it, the intensity of color describes the confidence in the prediction.\n\n\n\nTensorFlow has been touted as an effective machine learning framework since its introduction. However, it is time to reflect on queries like “Why TensorFlow is used in CNN?” to understand how TensorFlow supports neural networks. You can find the best answers for such queries in the new learning paradigm on TensorFlow for training neural networks. Neural Structured Learning, or NSL, is the new paradigm for training neural networks with the help of structured signals alongside feature inputs. The structure can be implicit, such as the one created due to adversarial perturbation, or explicitly represented in a graph.\n\nStructured signals generally help represent relations or the similarity between labeled or unlabeled samples. Using such signals during the training process helps capitalize on labeled and unlabeled data, thereby improving model accuracy. It works best in scenarios where you have a relatively small amount of labeled data. On top of it, TensorFlow neural network example also suggests that models trained on samples generated through addition of adversarial perturbation can have better resilience against malicious attacks.\n\nNSL can be generalized to adversarial learning and neural graph learning. The TensorFlow NSL framework offers different easy-to-use APIs and tools that help developers train models with structured signals. Some of the notable APIs and tools used for training neural network models include Keras APIs, TF ops, and functions and tools for building graphs and graph inputs for the training process.\n\nLearn about the prerequisites and important steps to Install TensorFlow Keras.\n\nThe importance of TensorFlow as a promising framework for neural network training revolves largely around Neural Structured Learning. It is an easy-to-use framework that helps beginners and expert developers in training neural networks by leveraging structured signals.\n\nA detailed review of TensorFlow neural network code would also point out the fact that NSL can help build robust and accurate models for computer vision, prediction, and language understanding tasks. With the help of structured signals, developers can achieve more accuracy and robust design of models. In addition, they have helped Google improve model performance, especially in learning image semantic embedding.\n\nNeural structured learning, or NSL, serves as an open-source framework that helps train deep neural networks by using structured signals. It utilizes neural graph learning that helps in training neural networks with graphs. Developers can obtain the graphs from different sources, such as multimodal relations, knowledge graphs, genomic data, and medical records.\n\nOn the other hand, the working of TensorFlow in neural network training also points to adversarial learning. The adversarial learning approach involves dynamic construction of the structure between input examples by leveraging adversarial perturbation.\n\nNeural Structured Learning helps TensorFlow users easily incorporate different structured signals for training of neural networks. On top of that, neural structured learning is applicable to various learning scenarios, such as supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning settings.\n\nBecome a master of generative AI applications by developing expert-level skills in prompt engineering with Prompt Engineer Career Path\n\nThe discussions about using TensorFlow for neural networks can be significantly challenging for anyone in the artificial intelligence landscape to interpret. It is obviously one of the top machine learning frameworks with different supporting features. However, the arrival of new features such as TensorFlow neural network playground and Neural Structured Learning have made the platform more capable of building and training neural networks.\n\nTensorFlow is a popular framework adopted by big companies such as Airbus, PayPal, and Twitter for different business use cases. Therefore, it is reasonable to explore the potential of TensorFlow to create advanced neural networks for innovative applications. Learn more about neural networks and their different variants to understand the significance of frameworks like TensorFlow for the future.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Cryptocurrencies have emerged as formidable tools in the landscape of modern financial systems. You can find more than 10,000 different types of cryptocurrencies today. Therefore, it is important to understand whether they can be included in the modern tax systems. You might have doubts regarding the best practices to track crypto transactions for taxes and reporting your crypto income. However, the perspectives on cryptocurrencies differ across governments, financial institutions, and users.\n\nFor example, the Central African Republic and El Salvador have already adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. On the contrary, critics point out that cryptocurrencies are useful only for scams, gambling, and crimes while emphasizing their volatility. Irrespective of the success or failure of cryptocurrencies, it is important to find a coherent approach to crypto taxation. Let us learn more about taxation for cryptocurrencies in the US and how you can track and report crypto transactions.\n\nEmbrace the technological leap and global adoption that awaits in the upcoming bull run of 2024-2025 with Crypto Bull Run Ready Career Path\n\nAt first glance, anyone would assume that cryptocurrencies are just digital assets. On the other hand, it is also important to note that tracking cryptocurrency transactions would also involve classifying them as currency. Upon selling cryptocurrencies for profit, the capital gains would be subject to taxation like other assets. On top of it, buying products or services with cryptocurrencies would also invite taxes according to the value-added or sales taxes applicable for cash transactions.\n\nBefore you look for a Bitcoin transaction tracker, you must also learn about the most formidable difficulty in taxing crypto assets. Cryptocurrencies are anonymous, and it is difficult to link crypto transactions with specific firms or individuals. Reporting rules on centralized exchanges can lead users towards decentralized exchanges or peer-to-peer transactions without the involvement of any centralized authority.\n\nWith such challenges, it is difficult to integrate crypto comprehensively into the larger tax system. Therefore, policymakers must come up with effective, clear, and coherent frameworks to avoid confusion regarding taxation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nEnroll now in the Bitcoin Technology Course to learn about Bitcoin mining and the information contained in transactions and blocks.\n\nCryptocurrencies are gradually gaining more popularity for mainstream adoption. Therefore, the United States Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, has been focusing more on taxation of cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, cryptocurrency is considered currency rather than property or merely a digital asset for implementing crypto tax.\n\nYou would need a crypto wallet transactions tracker to ensure accurate tracking and reporting of crypto transactions to avoid penalties. If you choose investments in crypto assets, such as non-fungible tokens, and use them for other profitable transactions, then you must prepare for crypto taxes.\n\nIt is important to remember that purchasing cryptocurrencies or the rise or fall in their value does not invite taxes. You would have to pay taxes when you invest, sell, or give away the cryptocurrencies for profits. The two common taxes for cryptocurrencies include capital gains tax and the income tax.\n\nCapital gains tax is applicable to profits achieved through the sale of assets purchased at lower prices. As you search for answers to “How to track crypto transactions?” you must know that capital gains tax comes into play when you raise profits from selling or trading digital assets. If you had the cryptocurrencies or assets for less than a year, then their sales or trades would be considered short-term gains. On the other hand, holding the assets for more than a year entitles them to long-term gain.\n\nSome of the important situations in which you have to pay capital gains tax include selling cryptocurrencies for fiat currency and sending cryptocurrencies with a value of more than $15,000 as gifts. You would understand the need to track crypto transactions for taxes by learning that buying any product or service with cryptocurrencies is also eligible for capital gains taxes.\n\nSwapping or trading one cryptocurrency for another asset also invites capital gains taxes. For example, you would incur capital gains taxes for buying NFTs with cryptocurrencies. Therefore, it is important to ensure the accurate tracking of all crypto transactions, as declarations of capital losses can alleviate capital gains tax.\n\n\n\nIncome tax is also an important aspect of cryptocurrency transactions. It is applicable to the financial rewards from staking and mining tokens. With the right Bitcoin transaction tracker, you can keep an eye on all the transactions that qualify for income taxes.\n\nFirst of all, you would have to pay income tax to receive cryptocurrency through airdrops. It is also important to note that income tax is applicable to cryptocurrencies when you earn interest from DeFi lending protocols. If you receive cryptocurrencies as payment for your work, then the transaction would be eligible for income tax.\n\nAnother crucial aspect that you must keep in mind before tracking cryptocurrency transactions is the duration of ownership. IRS implements long-term crypto tax rates for gains on cryptocurrencies that you have owned for more than a year. If you file taxes as a single individual, then you don’t have to pay any tax on gains measuring up to $44,625. On the other hand, married people or heads of household would have to pay taxes ranging from 0% to 20%, depending on the income tax brackets.\n\nTracking your crypto transactions also requires emphasis on learning about short-term gains. When you achieve profits on trading or selling cryptocurrencies that you held for less than a year, you will have to pay according to short-term crypto tax rates. The short-term crypto tax rates vary from 10% to 37% according to income brackets for heads of household, single filers, and married coups who choose joint filing.\n\nExcited to learn the basics of cryptocurrency and the ways in which blockchain technology empowers cryptocurrencies, Enroll now in the Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Course\n\nThe confusion about finding the answers to “How to track crypto transactions?” for taxation in the US would draw attention towards transactions that are not eligible for income tax or capital gains tax. Here is a list of crypto transactions that are not taxable in the US.\n\nStart learning about cryptocurrencies with world’s first Cryptocurrency Skill Path with quality resources tailored by industry experts!\n\nYou must ensure accurate tracking and reporting of all cryptocurrency transactions alongside consulting with a tax professional to address all tax obligations. Rather than using a crypto wallet transactions tracker, some users can opt for screenshots of the transactions they make in a year. However, some people may experience trouble in recording crypto transactions across all platforms. Therefore, you should choose special crypto tax software that can help you track crypto transactions and generate accurate reports.\n\nSome of the most popular options among such software include Accointing, Koinly, and CoinLedger. The uses of these tools are not similar to those of a Bitcoin transaction tracker, and they serve distinct purposes. Interestingly, all of these tools help in tracking crypto transactions. You can also go for a DIY approach with the following step-by-step guide to track and report crypto transactions.\n\nWant to get an in-depth understanding of crypto fundamentals, trading and investing strategies? Enroll now in the Crypto Fundamentals, Trading And Investing Course.\n\nThe steps to track crypto transactions for taxes should be followed by the best practices to report cryptocurrencies in your taxes. You can use the crypto tax form 8949 to report the sales and disposal of capital assets, such as cryptocurrencies. The form includes two parts, distinctively for short-term and long-term disposals. You would also have to select option C on form 8949 to report short-term transactions.\n\nIn the next step, you can report your crypto income on Form 1040. You can use Schedule C of Form 1040 to report crypto earnings as a business through payments for labor, staking income, or mining income. Keep in mind that you can also report crypto income from forks, airdrops, or other sources in Schedule 1 of Form 1040.\n\nThe challenges for implementation of taxation on cryptocurrencies revolve primarily around the pseudonymous nature of crypto assets. It is important to learn the best practices for tracking cryptocurrency transactions alongside the functionalities of tools for tracking crypto transactions and taxes.\n\nThe complexity of cryptocurrencies and the continuous innovation have created troubles for regulators and policymakers in the domain of cryptocurrencies. However, you should understand that cryptocurrencies are also subject to taxes such as capital gains taxes and income tax. Learn more about the best tools to track your crypto transactions and make the most of crypto taxes now.\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer: The article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide any investment advice.

    "content": "It’s not often that there’s a “best” educational resource for any particular subject. But if there’s one resource that Web3 developers point to, it’s former Chainlink Labs Developer Advocate Patrick Collin’s ultimate tutorials. They’re standout resources that have empowered countless developers to learn blockchains, learn Solidity, and dive deep into Web3 development.\n\nDepending on the edition, these videos can range from anywhere between 16 hours and 32 hours. They’re meant to be watched and rewatched over months and years, rather than seconds and minutes. While this can be a large time investment, there’s likely no better way to start learning how to code in Web3.\n\nIn this blog, we break down Patrick’s most recent tutorial—a three-part, ~27-hour step-by-step tutorial focused on the Foundry development toolkit—so students can understand exactly what they’ll learn by reading below.\n\nWeb3 development moves fast—it’s important to learn from up-to-date resources. This video currently represents one of the most recent and comprehensive Web3 courses that exist today.\n\nImportant Links:The Solidity Handbook by Chainlink Labs Developer Advocate Zubin Pratap is an all-in-one resource for when you need a quick refresher on Solidity concepts.\n\nIn the first lesson, Patrick provides the context needed to understand the layers of the Web3 tech stack. From industry terminology like “dApp” and “smart contract” to blockchain basics such as hashes, gas fees, and block headers, this lesson provides the background necessary to understand what’s unique about Web3 development.\n\nThis lesson introduces Remix, a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) for developing Solidity smart contracts. In just a few hours, Patrick provides a step-by-step walkthrough of basic Solidity concepts such as types, functions, arrays, mappings, and structs. Additionally, he outlines core development concepts such as memory, storage, and calldata.\n\nBy the end of this lesson, students will have set up their first smart contract and gained a basic understanding of Solidity and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)—a good first step for moving on to more complex and advanced contracts.\n\nIn this lesson, students will begin experimenting with more advanced coding concepts in Remix.\n\nMost decentralized applications today are built as a collection of smart contracts that all work together to create a unified application. This lesson teaches you how to create multiple smart contracts that interact with each other in a logical and efficient way. It also introduces one of the most important concepts not only in Web3 development but in computer science at large: Inheritance.\n\nIn the fourth lesson of this free blockchain course, students learn how to create a crowdfunding application through two different smart contracts: FundMe.sol and PriceConverter.sol.\n\nBy following along with and completing this demo application, students learn the basic keywords needed to securely send ether through a function and how to integrate Chainlink Price Feeds—the best-in-class price oracle solution for DeFi—to create price conversions. The lesson introduces both general and Solidity-specifc concepts such as loops, constructors, modifiers, immutability, constants, fallbacks, and interfaces.\n\nThis lesson focuses on enhancing your learning experience by providing tips for supercharging your learning experience, tips and tricks for setting up a GitHub and correctly formatting questions for the best results, and working with AI tools that can 10X learning and performance.\n\nStudents will also be introduced to SpeedRunEthereum, a platform designed to assist in their learning journey.\n\nLesson six of this blockchain course for beginners moves students from Remix to Foundry—an Ethereum developer toolkit written in the Rust programming language.\n\nPatrick provides step-by-step instructions on the installation and setup, with separate instructions for MacOS, Linux, and Windows, and introduces Gitpod as a tool for local development. Once everything is set up, students will learn how to work with the VSCode editor and frameworks such as ThirdWeb and Alchemy, as well as tools for deploying to local chains.\n\nLesson seven dives deeper into Foundry, with students learning how to test in a blockchain environment—including setup, debugging, and coverage.\n\nSpecifically, Patrick outlines how to better manage gas in the context of storage and withdrawals for smart contracts, walks through the process of testing and debugging code, and introduces advanced deploy scripts, refactoring, and magic numbers. Additionally, students will learn the logistical process needed to push code to GitHub—one of the most basic skills needed to work as a professional developer alongside a larger team.\n\nThis lesson provides a quick full-stack/front-end tutorial for creating a blockchain application using HTML and JavaScript.\n\nThrough this lesson, students will understand how the Metamask wallet works with their browser and get introduced to function selectors, which are crucial for interacting with smart contracts.\n\nIn lesson nine of this blockchain course, students will build a smart contract raffle demo using Foundry. They’ll learn how to set up a “Raffle.sol” contract that uses Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and Automation to generate a random number that’s used to pick the raffle winner.\n\nBy building this smart contract application with the help of Patrick’s step-by-step tutorial, students will learn about custom errors, events, and block.timestamp, how to generate random numbers on-chain using Chainlink VRF, and how to automate smart contract functions using Chainlink Automation.\n\nThis lesson covers everything ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment). By the end of this lesson, students will understand what an ERC, EIP, and ERC-20 are in a technical sense by following a series of steps.\n\nFirst, they’ll learn how to manually create an ERC-20 token, including the information needed to deeply understand the token standard. Then, students will learn how to use OpenZeppelin templates to create tokens (OpenZeppelin is a popular library for secure contract implementations) and then deploy their tokens on a testnet.\n\nAdditionally, students will learn how to build AI tests, which can streamline the process of testing blockchain applications.\n\nThis lesson introduces non-fungible tokens (NFTs), also known as the ERC-721 token standard.\n\nBy following along with Patrick in this lesson, students will learn what an NFT is, how to create an NFT smart contract, how to use decentralized storage solutions such as IPFS or create NFT images using SVG, and how to directly encode function calls.\n\nLesson 12 delves into the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), from stablecoins and lending to auditing, fuzz testing, and more. In the pinnacle lesson of this tutorial, students will get an overview of the DeFi ecosystem, learn about one of the most prominent token types (stablecoins), and walk step-by-step through the code needed to build a decentralized stablecoin.\n\nThis lesson also instructs students on how to work with DeFi protocols such as Aave’s lending protocol, which naturally covers concepts such as collateral, mints, price oracles, and liquidations. And because DeFi applications must make security their top priority, Patrick introduces one of the best testing techniques in Web3—fuzz testing.\n\nThis lesson provides an introduction to upgradeable smart contracts, which are how Web3 developers securely add functionality to immutable contracts.\n\nPatrick summarizes the different types of upgrade techniques, introduces delegate calls, and compares universal upgradable smart contract proxies (UUPS) to transparent proxy patterns.\n\nIn lesson 14, students will learn about another core Web3 concept—decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which are tools used for governing decentralized applications.\n\nPatrick not only explains what a DAO is at a fundamental level, but also provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up a DAO by creating a governance token and smart contract and running tests for your DAO smart contract to ensure correct functionality and execution.\n\nThe final lesson of the 27-hour development tutorial focuses on smart contract security and auditing.\n\nStudents will learn about the importance of smart contract audits, the process of manual review, and various tools and techniques used in the auditing process, such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, formal verification, and fuzzing.\n\nAs one of the best blockchain courses on the Internet today, Patrick’s 27-hour Foundry tutorial is a great starting point for anyone aiming to break into Web3 development, whether that means learning to code for the first time or transitioning skills from Web2.\n\nBecause there’s massive demand for smart contract developers and a relatively small talent pool, there’s heaps of opportunity available for those with the tenacity, will, and dedication to complete this 27-hour-long free blockchain course.

    "content": "Machine learning has spurred a formidable revolution in technology by enabling interactions between humans and machines. The common assumption about machine learning development process is that it is an extremely complex and technical process. For example, machine learning projects require data processing, comprehensive model training, deployment, and maintenance.\n\nOn the other hand, the process of developing machine learning models also requires attention to in-depth business acumen, data analytics, model development, model evaluation, and skills in data collection techniques. Machine learning experts must know the development lifecycle and the steps that offer structure to machine learning projects.\n\nBusinesses can rely on the commonly followed roadmap for their ML projects to come up with cost-effective, high-quality, and sustainable artificial intelligence products. Let us learn more about the essential steps in a machine learning project development lifecycle and the important factors for project success in each step.\n\n\n\nDevelopment of an AI model can be complex, and people with expertise in machine learning also struggle to achieve success. The ML development process is complex and requires a perfect blend of creativity, diligence, and experimentation. Interestingly, you can simplify the complete process of designing, deploying, and managing ML models in a general pattern. Awareness of the steps helps you understand the process of ML model development and improves your command of the best practices to guide your project to success.\n\nEvery step in the machine learning development lifecycle is crucial to the success of the project. Therefore, it is important to establish some safeguards in the form of quality assurance frameworks to ensure constant improvement and maintenance in adherence to constraints and specific requirements. In addition, you must have in-depth knowledge of machine learning fundamentals, deep learning, modeling, and ML training techniques. Once you have all the prerequisites, you can begin the development project with the help of the following roadmap.\n\nThe answers to queries like “How is machine learning developed?” create curiosity about the underlying technologies. On the other hand, it is important to ensure that you know why you are building a new ML model. The first step in any ML development project begins with planning, as it helps in assessment of scope, feasibility, and success metrics of machine learning applications. It is also important to understand how the ML model would address the problems of a business. The planning phase gives you time to think about how you can leverage machine learning to improve current processes.\n\nAnother crucial aspect in the planning stage of the ML development lifecycle is the cost-benefit analysis. You must also establish a clear timeline for shipping the ML solution in different phases. In addition, you must provide effective, measurable metrics for ML models, business indicators, and economic indicators.\n\nOn top of it, the planning stage also requires the creation of a feasibility report. The feasibility report must include information about availability of data, legal constraints, explainability, applicability, resilience, and scalability. You must also include information about resources available for the project in the feasibility report.\n\nExcited to learn practical implications of AI for business strategies, society, and the future of technology? Enroll now in AI For Business Course\n\nThe business case for the machine learning project helps build a framework for designing the next steps of the project. Data is the lifeblood of machine learning projects, and the model development process actually begins with identification of data requirements. ML models gain generalized insights from the training data and apply the knowledge acquired from the training process to come up with new predictions.\n\nThe most important aspects for determining the data needs include the type and quantity of data, quality of training data, and the data sources. In addition, you must also consider whether you can utilize a pre-trained machine learning model to ensure that you make the right choice.\n\nThe process for determining the data requirements of a machine learning project also involves understanding the ways in which the model would work with real-world data. Would you need data for real-time use cases with higher performance requirements? Such types of questions can help you determine data access requirements with better accuracy.\n\nYou must pay attention to data preparation in ML projects as it determines what your machine learning model will learn. The machine learning development process relies significantly on the four pillars of data preparation: data collection and labeling, cleaning, processing, and management. Here are some of the important steps that you must follow for data preparation in ML development projects.\n\nDevelopers must determine how they would collect data by identifying the ideal data sources. Some of the popular data sources include internal data, vendors, synthetic data generation, and open-source platforms. The different data sources have unique strengths and limitations, and some projects may require all the data sources. After collecting the data, you must label it to make changes during the development lifecycle. Data collection and labeling is a time-intensive and intricate process that consumes majority of company resources.\n\nData cleaning or refinement is another prominent highlight in answers to “How is machine learning developed?” in the data preparation phase. It involves imputing missing values, reducing noise, removing outliers, and analysis of data with wrong labels. You would also develop data pipelines for automation of the process and performing verification of data quality.\n\nData processing during data preparation focuses on feature selection and management of imbalanced classes. The phase also involves data augmentation, feature engineering, data scaling, and normalization. Developers also ensure the storage and versioning of the metadata alongside data modeling during the data processing stage. You will also need feature stores and transformation pipelines to reproduce the important training data.\n\nThe final step in the data preparation phase of the ML development process emphasizes data management. It invites the limelight towards identification of effective data storage solutions. Developers can leverage solutions like ETL pipelines to achieve a constant data stream to support training of models.\n\nIdentify new ways to leverage the full potential of generative AI in business use cases and become an expert in generative AI technologies with Generative AI Skill Path\n\nThe model engineering phase in the machine learning development project involves the use of information from planning phase for developing and training ML models. Model engineering phase includes tracking model metrics, optimization of compute resources and storage, and achieving scalability.\n\nIt is important to know that the ML development lifecycle starts with development of an effective model architecture through extensive research. Model engineering also involves quantification of model metrics alongside training and validation of the model on the validation and training dataset. Developers have to focus on tracking experiments, features, machine learning pipelines, metadata, and modifications in the code.\n\nThe model engineering stage also involves model compression and ensembling alongside effective interpretation of results by leveraging domain knowledge expertise. Developers should also maintain clear documentation of features, ML experiments, hyperparameters, development environment, metadata, and model architecture for easier retrieval.\n\n\n\nWhen you have the final version of the model you think would be the best for a public release, you have to test it on the basis of different metrics. The model assessment stage helps in ensuring that the model is ready to go into production. Model assessment empowers the machine learning development process by testing ML models on test datasets to ensure that subject matter experts can find the errors in responses by the model. The model assessment step involves following industrial, legal, and ethical frameworks for the development of ML models.\n\nModel assessment also focuses on testing models for resilience on real-world and random data. Therefore, it can help you verify whether the model is capable of generating faster responses. In addition, you should also test the model results against the predefined success metrics and determine whether you can deploy the model. Proper documentation of all assessment processes helps strengthen quality assurance and backup for ML development projects.\n\nWant to understand the importance of ethics in AI, ethical frameworks, principles, and challenges? Enroll now in Ethics Of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Course!\n\nThe final stage in the answers for “How machine learning is developed?” is the deployment phase. You have to deploy the ML models to the system you have for the ML project. Let us assume that you have created a model for automatic warehouse labeling based on product dimensions.\n\nThe model would require a computer vision model in the existing warehouse system that would use images for creating and printing labels. Developers can deploy ML models on web browsers, the cloud and local servers, and edge devices or package them as software solutions. The deployment process also involves definition of the inference hardware and ensuring that you have adequate storage, computing power, and RAM for generating faster results.\n\nThe use of machine learning to drive the AI revolution has invited curiosity about the working of ML projects. The ML development process can vary from one organization to another, depending on the goals of the project. However, the process for developing ML models follows a general pattern in which you can find a few distinct steps.\n\nThe important steps in ML development projects include planning, data requirements analysis, data preparation, model engineering, and model assessment. Enroll now in AI certification to learn about the best practices for updating and maintaining the ML models. Find more insights on how machine learning models work and build your own project now.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) inched toward the $66,000 level early Tuesday to pare all gains from last week as sentiment was dented as a significant amount of the asset was moved from U.S. government-linked wallets, instilling fears of looming selling pressure among traders.\n\nBTC lost as much as 5%, before slightly recovering, in the past 24 hours as the U.S. Marshals Service shifted $2 billion worth of BTC to two new wallets. Tracking service Arkham estimated that at least one of these wallets was likely to be a custodial service.\n\nSolana’s SOL led losses among majors with a 6% dump, reversing Monday gains. Token prices surged as memecoin trading heated up on the network over the weekend, with on-chain trading volumes surging over Ethereum, the usual leader.\n\nOther majors showed similar losses amid the bitcoin decline.

    "summary": "US Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump made his much-anticipated appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville.\n\n",
    "content": "US Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump made his much-anticipated appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville on July 27. Trump made several promises to the crypto voters in attendance, including what he would do to the US government’s Bitcoin holdings if elected.\n\nDuring the Bitcoin conference, Trump stated that if elected, his administration would implement a policy mandating the US government to keep “100%” of the Bitcoin it currently holds or acquires. Trump made this statement while remarking that the government has, up until now, “violated a cardinal rule that every Bitcoiner knows by heart,” which is never to sell their BTC.\n\nData from the on-chain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence shows that the US government currently holds 213,239 BTC ($14.87 billion). However, the government is known to have offloaded some of its holdings in the past, with its last confirmed sale coming in April when it sold 1,754 BTC.\n\nTrump’s plan for the US to hold all of its Bitcoin holdings undoubtedly provides a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, considering the impact that the US government’s BTC sales have had on the token’s price in the past. Moreover, the US holds the most Bitcoin among all governments. Therefore, such a move could remove a significant amount of Bitcoin from circulation for a considerable period.\n\nIt is worth noting that most of the US government’s Bitcoin holdings came about through the seizures made from the dark web marketplace Silk Road, which Ross Ulbricht created. Interestingly, Trump again reaffirmed his promise to commute Ulbricht’s sentence if he is elected.\n\nHowever, even if he eventually becomes a free man, it remains unlikely that Ulbricht will be able to recover the 50,591 BTC that was reportedly recovered from the hacker who stole Ulbricht and Silk Road in a previous hack. This is because the Silk Road founder forfeited claims to these funds in 2022 to offset the unpaid balance of his money judgment.\n\nBefore the conference, Trump had already affirmed his support for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This led to several predictions that Bitcoin could reach unprecedented heights if Trump wins the US presidential elections in November. For instance, Standard Chartered predicted that Bitcoin could reach $150,000 by year-end if the former President wins.\n\nA Trump victory is also expected to usher in clearer and more favorable crypto regulations, which will undoubtedly positively impact crypto prices. This is most likely to happen, seeing how the US Securities and Exchange’s (SEC) regulation by enforcement approach has left a sour taste on the crypto market. Interestingly, Trump promised to fire the SEC chair, Gary Gensler, who has spearheaded this approach from the Commission so far.\n\n",

    "summary": "The FAANGs are expected to dominate stock market. How are they doing on the blockchain front?\n\n",
    "content": "For investors, blockchain and FAANG are two magic words that can move markets. Mere association of a stock with those two words can make a stock seem more attractive. (See also: Riot Stock Rallies As Blockchain Tech Goes Mainstream.)Investor enthusiasm for blockchain and FAANG is due to their future bullish prospects. Even as FAANG dominates the internet ecosystem, blockchain is set to reinvent the internet and its associated services. Here is a brief primer on how each of the FAANG companies is preparing for the blockchain future.\n\nFacebook Inc. (FB)\n\nFacebook recently announced a high-profile reorganization, moving prominent executives from successful product lines, and placing them into positions of authority within a newly formed blockchain group. David Marcus, who previously headed the company’s successful Messenger services, said the intent of his “small group” was to “explore how to best leverage blockchain across Facebook, starting from scratch.” (See also: Facebook\u0027s Bad News. Good News For Blockchain?)The threat to Facebook stems from an inversion of its current business model, where it makes money by selling user data to advertisers. A blockchain world envisages users who have personal control of their data and choose to share it only with parties that they trust. It is still a while before that future comes to pass. According to Spencer Bogart, a venture capitalist at Blockchain Capital, blockchain is not “an existential threat to Facebook today”. But it might become one in the future. “That’s why they [Facebook] want to be smart and stay engaged,” he said.\n\nGoogle (GOOGL)\n\nAccording to reports, Alphabet Inc.\u0027s subsidiary Google plans to use blockchain for securing customer data on its cloud services. The idea is to have a white label version for companies to use on their servers. Google has also invested in blockchain startups through its venture investing arm Google Ventures (GV). The companies in GV’s portfolio comprise a diverse palette. For example, crypto wallet provider LedgerX is one of their investments as is bank transfer company Ripple. As with Facebook, it is still too early to quantify the impact of these investments on Google’s bottom line in the near term.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (AMZN)\n\nAmazon competitor Walmart Inc. (WMT) made news last year when it announced a supply chain implementation of blockchain last year to enable customers to determine provenance of its consumer goods. It would seem that Amazon has taken a different route. The Seattle-based company launched AWS Blockchain Templates in its cloud service recently to deploy frameworks for ethereum and Hyperledger on its cloud platform recently. The offering is part of its plan to offer Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS). Competitors to Amazon in this arena include International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Oracle Corp. (ORCL). (See also: All About Amazon\u0027s New Blockchain.)Apple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nThe iPhone maker has been characteristically silent regarding its blockchain moves. But Coindesk discovered a patent filed by Apple last December that makes use of blockchain technology to create timestamps. In its patent application, the company said that blockchain technology can be used to build resilience in a distributed system of elements, such as a SIM or MicroSD card. The timestamps are part of a “multi-check architecture” system proposed by Apple. Timestamps will be verified by another system before they are added to the main chain. (See also: Is Apple Planning to Use Blockchain?)Netflix Inc. (NFLX)\n\nOf all the companies within the FAANG group, Netflix is, perhaps, most threatened by blockchain. The video-streaming company has not made any announcements regarding investments in blockchain, but the drumrolls for its demise due to blockchain have already begun. A popular post by Rizwan Virk earlier this year outlined a scenario where a decentralized platform using blockchain technology could get rid of the centralized architecture and traditional gatekeepers of the content business. While it has displaced cable and disrupted linear television viewing habits, Netflix is still the gatekeeper to content on its platform. As such, content makers still need its stamp of approval before their content can be viewed. In the decentralized world, content makers and technology entrepreneurs will be able to make and stream their own content on a subject of their own choosing. The token model could also upend existing business models by making it possible to purchase individual shows with tokens on an entertainment network.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

Layer 1 scaling includes updates to main blockchains, such as the block size, consensus mechanism, or database partitioning. Layer 2 scaling includes bundling transactions, processing in parallel, or handling transactions off-chain.

    "content": "Layer 1 and Layer 2: An Overview\n\nLayer 1 and Layer 2 blockchain scaling solutions are improvements to the throughput—or processing speed—of any cryptocurrency blockchain network. They can include protocol updates or additional network solutions to help process more transactions.\n\nLayer 1 includes updates such as changing block sizes, consensus mechanisms, or splitting the database into multiple parts (known as sharding). Layer 2 includes rollups (bundling transactions), parallel blockchains (known as side chains), and off-chain handling of transactions (known as state channels).\n\nWhy Layer 1 and Layer 2 Scaling Solutions Are Important\n\nA blockchain is a decentralized network of nodes that processes crypto transactions independently, with consensus protocols that verify the accuracy of the transactions. The transactions are then recorded sequentially, forming a chain of data blocks that can’t be changed.\n\nUnfortunately, the more popular a blockchain becomes (Bitcoin is a case in point), the more processing power it needs to handle its growing number of transactions. Cryptocurrency blockchain protocols also may limit the number of transactions that can be processed, creating a bottleneck in the network.\n\nThis has caused popular blockchain networks to become very slow, sometimes taking up to 10 minutes (or more) to process a transaction. To solve this issue, scaling activities have been developed to help provide a more efficient means of holding a much larger volume of transactions.\n\nThere are several ways to scale each network, and dozens of scaling solutions have been developed for various popular blockchains. These solutions help offload the transaction processing power onto other networks or improve the base-layer network itself through a code update.\n\nLayer 1 Blockchains vs. Layer 2 Blockchains\n\nA Layer 1 blockchain is the base architecture for a decentralized cryptocurrency network. Examples of Layer 1 blockchains include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano. These blockchains handle transaction processing and network security through a shared consensus mechanism, such as proof of work (PoW) or proof of stake (PoS).\n\nA Layer 2 blockchain refers to another blockchain or set of protocols layered \"on top\" of a Layer 1 solution. Layer 2 protocols use the Layer 1 blockchain for network and security infrastructure but are more flexible in their ability to scale transaction processing and overall throughput on the network. Examples are Polygon (which layers on top of Ethereum) and Bitcoin\u0027s Lightning Network. Coinbase launched Base, its Ethereum Layer 2 network, in August 2023.\n\nTypes of Layer 1 Blockchain Scaling Solutions\n\nThere are several ways to scale Layer 1 blockchains, including:Some Layer 1 cryptocurrency blockchains have updated their code to increase the block size, allowing more transactions to be verified at a time, thus expanding the overall capacity of the network. An example of this is the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network, which upgraded its block size to 8 megabytes (MBs) from 1 MB, then further to 32 MBs, theoretically allowing it to process more than 100 transactions per second vs. Bitcoin’s seven transactions per second.\n\nThe consensus mechanism of a blockchain validates transactions to ensure the accuracy and security of the network. Bitcoin, for example, uses proof-of-work (PoW) consensus, requiring tremendous processing power to solve a cryptographic puzzle to be allowed to record the next block in the blockchain. Once the puzzle is solved, the blockchain confirms transactions in the blocks by verifying block hashes.\n\nEthereum also initially used PoW but has since upgraded to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, which requires node operators to lock up a large Ether (ETH) deposit to process transactions.\n\nSharding is similar to database partitioning, which allows a blockchain database to be broken up into smaller parts so that transactions can be processed simultaneously. This increases the overall capacity of a Layer 1 blockchain network.\n\nTypes of Layer 2 Blockchain Scaling Solutions\n\nThere are also several types of Layer 2 blockchain scaling solutions, including:Instead of processing transactions individually, bundles of transactions can be “rolled up” into a single transaction, vastly increasing the number of transactions that can be processed at once. The transactions are outsourced to be recorded off-chain, bundled, and then brought onto the main chain to process as a single entity.\n\nSide chains are independent blockchain networks with their own set of validators that allow transactions to be processed in parallel. This vastly increases the transaction-processing power of a blockchain, but you must trust the integrity of the side chain network and the bridge network that connects it to the main blockchain.\n\nState channels are similar to a side chain, as transactions are recorded off-chain, but these transactions are recorded in bulk off-chain, and then the state of the channel is set at complete. The transactions are then recorded in bulk on the main blockchain network by broadcasting a completed “state” to the main network. This is how Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is set up.\n\nRisks of Layer 1 and Layer 2 Blockchain Scaling Solutions\n\nWhile scaling a blockchain is a great way to improve transaction handling and increase overall adoption, there are a few risks inherent to using a scaling solution:The Bottom Line\n\nScaling a blockchain network is important to a cryptocurrency network\u0027s overall adoption and increased capacity. Both Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling solutions help preserve the integrity of the underlying blockchain while improving the ability to handle far more transactions.\n\n",

    "title": "Is Blockchain Replacing the SIM Card?",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The clock is ticking until eSIMs are the new status quo, and blockchain will help them arrive precisely on time.\n\nCompanies are exploring blockchain technology in order to save their customers time and hassle with physical SIM cards by offering fully-digital eSIM options. Blockchain is a relatively new technology, but one that is widely used and fairly secure. Some customers still prefer the ease of switching out physical SIM cards between phones, especially when traveling. eSIMS can be instantly assigned and downloaded once the carrier\u0027s terms and conditions are met and payment is processed. Currently, SIMs are operating on technology that hasn\u0027t changed much since it was introduced in 1991.\n\nBlockchain has no central database to exploit, which is one of the main reasons it is so secure.\n\n",
    "content": "The telecommunications industry has experienced more than its fair share of change, and by necessity has evolved extremely quickly. As computing and communications have merged, the industry has had to deal with debates about privacy and data ownership, and major companies have quickly morphed into the giants of today.\n\nAt the same time, the technology that powers telecommunications is rapidly changing, and old standards are being challenged. The SIM card, one of the staples of mobile phones, is facing obsolescence as digital solutions offer significant improvements. With the help of new concepts like blockchain, the smartphones of tomorrow may look familiar, but their technology will be a massive leap forward.\n\nCombining Communications Tech With Blockchain\n\nThe blockchain revolution continues to gather steam, and for good reason. Blockchain’s distributed ledger is a powerful system for democratically organizing the nodes—or users—on its network while rewarding them for lending processing power and other resources.\n\nBlockchain’s decentralized ledger has laid the foundation for ideas that include a decentralized cloud storage network, self-sovereign banks, and transparent voting systems. More importantly, however, it could also radically change the way our smartphones operate.\n\nDespite the bells and whistles that smartphones offer today, the technology that drives them is surprisingly outdated. Most smartphones still use the SIM (Subscriber Identity Module), a physical memory card that was first developed back in 1991. It holds the identity and cellular network details of each user, including their phone number, name, service provider, and other information.\n\nSIMs are a relatively basic way to upgrade a phone as one simply removes the card and plugs it into a new device. Switching providers isn’t as easy and still requires customers to request a new SIM card be mailed to them or to drive to a brick-and-mortar store for a new SIM.\n\nWhile other hardware-based storage tools upgraded to digital technology—much like video games went from cartridges to digital downloads—SIM technology remains essentially the same as it did when it was created. Now, its dominance is being challenged by eSIM technology, which was first deployed by Google. With blockchain’s help, it’s set to hit the wider market and make a larger splash.\n\neSIM Technology and Blockchain Create New Markets\n\nThe eSIM is essentially software that holds the same information as a regular SIM but on a digital module instead of a physical chip. Apple already deploys it in its Apple Watch and iPad products, which tout slimness and couldn’t afford to incorporate even the tiniest of memory cards.\n\nThough the move was mostly intended to cut out cell service providers, Apple and Google first showed the efficacy of the eSIM model by selling their devices without a pre-loaded service provider. Customers could simply choose from any number of providers and data packages once connected to Wi-Fi, saving them precious time and effort.\n\nConsumers also save money with eSIMs, which is a threat to service providers who charge installation fees and upsell relevant products in their branches. If centralized companies like Apple and Google can use eSIMs to disrupt this lucrative cash flow and simultaneously offer more flexibility for consumers, it’s easy to imagine what the technology can accomplish when combined with blockchain. Keepgo recognized the opportunity early and is putting the plan into motion.\n\nSoon, devices with eSIMs will be able to connect to KeepGo’s distributed marketplace, where users can enjoy a bigger selection of data plans with greater transparency. Instead of purchasing the right to surf from a third party, users will be able to choose their provider in a decentralized network. The twist is that other users are the providers and share their data with others via KeepGo’s Decentralized Megabyte Exchange.\n\nSimilarly, blockchain-based services have started popping up looking to be the first to corner the emerging market. Dent Wireless, for instance, offers a service that lets users purchase mobile data directly on their mobile phones, as well as send data. QLink, another blockchain telecommunications pioneer, is building out its infrastructure to provide tools like wi-fi sharing, mobile data, and even enterprise-to-peer services.\n\nFighting for the Future\n\neSIM and blockchain are disruptive technologies, yet they face significant resistance from entrenched industry players. Even so, they’re finding their way into the world thanks to consumer-minded innovators and companies that see the value of changing with the times.\n\nDespite the sometimes-slow progress, both technologies have long since secured their continued existence. The clock is ticking until eSIMs are the new status quo, and blockchain—itself pushing through various industry obstacles—will help them arrive precisely on time.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\neSIMs are not a new idea, but rolling them out to the general public via blockchain is relatively new. Telecom giants like Verizon, Telus, and Vodafone have all explored the potential of the disruptive technology but as of 2022, almost all phone users are still operating their lines on physical SIM cards.\n\n",

At Consensus 2022, CoinDesk relaunched DESK as a full-fledged on-chain social token, making it a core part of the experience at our first live event since 2019.\n\nIn December 2022, CoinDesk expanded the functionality of DESK to integrate the token into the broader user experience. Now, readers can earn DESK by reading articles, watching videos and more on CoinDesk.com.\n\nRead More: DESK Upgrade on CoinDesk’s Website Offers Tokenized Reader Experience\n\nBelow is everything you need to know about DESK and how to use it. This post will be updated regularly as we build out the DESK program, so check back every so often for the latest information.\n\nDESK is CoinDesk’s social token.\n\nDESK is designed to build a community around the CoinDesk brand and to reward our audience for engaging with our content.\n\nDESK’s ethos is modeled on the founding principles of blockchain technology: openness, community, empowerment and innovation. We hope to use DESK to create a feedback loop with our users to help us build out an ecosystem together.\n\nAs of this update, you can start earning DESK by creating an account at coindesk.com and engaging with our content, such as reading Consensus Magazine articles. Other ways to earn DESK include:\n\nAt Consensus 2022, attendees were able to redeem DESK for such rewards as:\n\nDESK runs on Polygon, a sidechain, or parallel network, to Ethereum.\n\nPolygon helps us provide a gasless experience because of the lower costs per transaction.\n\nYou’ll need to set up a cryptocurrency wallet that works with Polygon. MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are the easiest ones to use for beginners.\n\nRead more: Get Started With DESK: How to Set Up Your Wallet\n\nYes. With the new release in Dec. 2022, you will be required to have a coindesk.com account.\n\nIn the Web2 era, content creators – be they writers, artists, filmmakers, publishers, media outlets or event organizers – have become beholden to the algorithms of intermediating platforms, complicating their efforts to directly reach and engage audiences. Simply put, the web ended up replacing one set of gatekeepers (major newspapers, magazines and television networks) with another (social media and search engines).\n\nWe’re hopeful, like many others, that crypto and Web3 solutions involving tokens and new data and governance models will facilitate a more direct relationship with our audience and the expansion of a community of engaged participants that is independent of the platforms.\n\nWe believe Consensus, which moves the content creator-audience relationship out of the digital realm and into a physical space where internet gatekeepers have less influence, is a great place to experiment with new tokens and incentive models in pursuit of this goal.\n\nWe hope DESK generates a community that engages year-round in rich interaction with each other and with CoinDesk articles and other content and then comes back each year to gather in person at this cornerstone annual event.\n\nSocial tokens allow for community-driven tech by creating a feedback loop between product creators and product users. This will allow the DESK team to get real-time data on engagement based on DESK usage, and use that data to iterate on the DESK ecosystem, aligning it more and more to user needs and wants.\n\nInitially, the blockchain provides us with data on DESK usage. The blockchain also discourages insider deals or under-the-table giveaways because the public ledger would lay bare any such misbehavior. This means everyone who claims NFTs or physical rewards had to put in the work (engaging with our content) to earn their reward.\n\nSimply put: DESK will be used to align our efforts as a media and events company to the wants and needs of our audience.\n\nNo. DESK is not a currency, nor is it a financial asset or investment product of any kind. It is not for speculation and will not make anyone rich. This is not a vehicle for anyone’s savings nor is it a money-making opportunity.\n\nIt is a reward token, analogous to airline frequent-flier miles, hotel guest points and the like. CoinDesk will be taking strong measures to discourage its use for speculation or trading.\n\nBy providing a system where users can contribute to the functioning of a collective, digital system, the blockchain lays the foundation for a new type of organization: the tokenized community. We\u0027ve seen examples of this over the past few years with NFT communities and distributed autonomous organizations (DAO). To highlight this blockchain use case, we decided to focus on activating and expanding social utility to create community value, instead of focusing on monetization.\n\nNo. DESK can only be earned as a reward for engaging with CoinDesk events and content, or as a tip from fellow users.\n\nNo. See above.\n\nNo. We\u0027re not selling the token at all, just distributing it to audience members as a reward for their engagement.\n\nListing, buying or trading DESK is against our terms of use because we want the rewards and value to come from inside the ecosystem. We reserve the right to ban accounts and blacklist wallet addresses that violate our terms of use.\n\nIt’s important to remember that not all blockchain assets are fully decentralized or claim to be so. Ether, the native currency of Ethereum, is completely user-controlled, but ERC-20 tokens built on top of the network may or may not be, depending on how the issuer designs it. For example, a number of regulated stablecoins are ERC-20 tokens, and their issuers have the power to freeze funds of suspect addresses to comply with law enforcement requests.\n\nSo, no, DESK is not decentralized, nor does it purport to be. It is not competing with bitcoin or ether.\n\nPart of the value DESK provides is what CoinDesk injects into the ecosystem when we want to reward our users for engaging at a deeper level. This means being able to use your DESK to redeem food and drinks at establishments that CoinDesk partners with on the ground.\n\nNo. The DESK ecosystem is 100% gasless.\n\nCoinDesk is covering the gas costs on Polygon.\n\nBecause DESK has transitioned from testnet to mainnet, DESK collected in 2021 is no longer usable. That being said, we value the feedback and effort from DESK\u0027s beta testers.\n\nPiranhas are the fledgling community that formed around DESK during Consensus 2021. They started their own Discord channel and created memes about the token. The phenomenon was a clear validation for CoinDesk of the concept.\n\nAt Consensus 2022, the official hub of the DESK community was CoinDesk’s Discord server, where we welcomed the Piranhas and newcomers alike.\n\nCoinDesk did, with the help of several key external partners, including Coinvise and others.\n\nAs mentioned, MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are easiest to use, but any wallet that works on Polygon can be used.\n\nNavigate to the DESK dashboard. Select \"Create or Connect Wallet\" and approve the transaction in your wallet.\n\nDepends. CoinDesk can associate identities with wallets only when users create accounts on desk.coindesk.com. We will not use this data for anything other than authenticating users when they sign on or distributing DESK rewards, we will never sell it, and we will protect user information assiduously. (See our privacy policy.) DESK transactions will appear on DESK\u0027s page on the Polyscan block explorer, but only the wallet addresses will be displayed.\n\nDESK has no inherent monetary value, but, whether or not you live in a jurisdiction where utility tokens are deemed taxable, you should consult a tax professional if you have concerns.\n\nWe’ll keep a record of airdrops, product developments and other updates critical to DESK’s roadmap and tokenomics in our DESK product blog.\n\nYou can also keep abreast of DESK updates in our Discord server.\n\nThe latest release is only the beginning in developing our Web3 model for DESK on coindesk.com. We\u0027ll be working on improving our wallet functionality, currently in beta, and looking forward to seeing what data and reader feedback reveal as to how to continue improving the experience\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blocks are files that permanently record cryptocurrency transaction data; once written, they cannot be altered or removed.\n\nA block is a file where information is stored and encrypted. Blocks are identified by long numbers that include encrypted transaction information from previous blocks and new transaction information. Blocks and the information within them must be verified by a network before new blocks can be created. Blocks and blockchains are not used solely by cryptocurrencies. They also have many other uses.\n\nSolving for the hash under the proof-of-work protocol is what takes so much energy and computational power. Proof-of-work blockchains adjust mining difficulty based on how fast the network can hash. The Bitcoin network has so much hashing power, and the difficulty is so high it hashes at about 600 exahashes (quintillion, or 18 zeros) per second, and takes about 10 minutes to solve the Bitcoin hashing puzzle.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Block (Blockchain Block)?\n\nBlocks are files stored by a blockchain, where transaction data are permanently recorded. A block records some or all of the most recent transactions not yet validated by the network. Once the data are validated, the block is closed. Then, a new block is created for new transactions to be entered into and validated.\n\nA block is thus a permanent store of records that, once written, cannot be altered or removed without changing all preceding or following blocks.\n\nHow a Block (Blockchain Block) Works\n\nA blockchain network witnesses a great deal of transaction activity. The transactions made during a period are recorded into a file called a block, which is the basis of the blockchain network.\n\nA block stores information. There are many pieces of information included within a block, but it doesn\u0027t occupy a large amount of storage space. Blocks generally include these elements, but it might vary between different types. For example, Bitcoin block structures include:The transaction element is the largest because it contains the most information. It is followed in storage size by the block header, which includes these sub-elements:One 32-bit (four bytes) number in the header is called a nonce (number used once). The nonce is increased with every guess by a value of one. In Bitcoin\u0027s case, the nonce can only go up to a value of about 4 billion before it rolls over to zero again (which takes less than one second). Once this happens, another value called the extra nonce is changed, and the nonce starts over again at zero.\n\nOnce the right combination of block data, nonce, and extra nonce are found, the miner wins the competition. The network closes that block, generates a new one with a header, and the process repeats.\n\nDifferent mechanisms are used to reach a consensus; the most popular for cryptocurrency is proof-of-work (PoW), with proof-of-stake (PoS) becoming more so because of the reduced energy consumption compared to PoW.\n\nThe XRP Ledger uses a mechanism similar to proof-of-history (PoH), where a deterministic transactional ordering algorithm prevents double-spending.\n\nMining\u0027s Relationship to Blocks\n\nMining is the term used for solving the cryptographic puzzle, which acts as the first verification for transactions and proof that work was done to do the verification.\n\nCryptocurrency mining is commonly thought to be solving a complex mathematical problem; mining is actually sending block data through a hashing algorithm (which uses complicated math functions) to generate a hexadecimal number.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin uses the hashing algorithm SHA-256. For a miner to generate the \"winning\" number, the mining program sends the block header, nonce, and the extra nonce through SHA-256. The two nonces are adjusted incrementally until a certain value is reached. This value is another hexadecimal number that requires the network to spend about 10 minutes generating hashes.\n\nOther Block and Blockchain Uses\n\nBecause most blockchain definitions refer to Bitcoin because it was the first cryptocurrency to use one, many people associate blocks and blockchains with Bitcoin. However, other cryptocurrencies use blocks and blockchains as well. It\u0027s important to note that Ethereum\u0027s network also uses blocks and blockchain.\n\nHowever, Ethereum and its blockchain were designed for multiple uses that extend to much more than cryptocurrency. For example, non-fungible tokens, smart contracts, decentralized finance applications, and more have been developed using Ethereum.\n\nBlock and Blockchain Developments\n\nCryptocurrency introduced blockchains to the mainstream, but these distributed ledgers have been under development for many years. Blocks are files that store information, so much more can be done with them than issuing a token that can be used as payment or to invest in.\n\nBlocks and blockchains create unchangeable records. Public blockchains can be widely distributed and nearly impossible to alter, while private blockchains can be secured using accounts and permissions. Permissioned public blockchains are a combination of public and private blockchains. These three types set the stage for what some believe to be the next iteration of the way information and content are stored, accessed, controlled, and secured.\n\nThe backbone of the modern world is connectivity and the internet. Information and content are hosted and stored on centralized servers controlled by businesses and governments. This allows them to censor what you are exposed to, monetize (or demonetize) any content you create, track your spending and viewing habits, set restrictions on what you can and can\u0027t do, and much more.\n\nBlockchain developers are developing systems designed to replace the structure of the web. This emerging structure is commonly called Web 3. Web 3 is a concept that combines tokens, wallets, cryptocurrencies, and blockchains to overhaul the web\u0027s infrastructure and transition ownership of digital content and assets back to creators.\n\nBlockchain Impacts for Individuals\n\nOne of the most significant impacts of blockchains on individuals is access to financial services. Even in developed countries, some people do not have access to personal or business loans, credit, or other financial instruments that could help them achieve financial independence and stability.\n\nAnother important expectation for blockchain and Web 3 development is that they will allow you to control how your personal information is used. Information such as your age, income, what you watch, and what you\u0027re shopping for is valuable to businesses. Businesses pay other companies for your information so that they can market specifically to you and others who share your interests.\n\nIf you controlled your information using tokens, you could sell it to a business and make money from it rather than someone else using your information to earn revenue. Even better, imagine placing only the information you want businesses to have in a smart contract. If an entity wanted it, they would have to pay you for it using cryptocurrency. The blockchain would release it, you\u0027d be paid, and the smart contract could keep the business from reselling it to another company without your permission.\n\nBlockchain Impacts for Businesses\n\nBusinesses in all sectors are exploring ways to use blockchains. Insurance companies can use it to facilitate insurance claims and fraud investigations, and the legal industry can use it to reduce time and costs.\n\nIntellectual property rights have always been an issue, with thefts, piracy, and fraud costing billions of dollars. Creators, media, and entertainment providers can tokenize and track content to protect their interests.\n\nFinancial service providers can have access to more individuals. Businesses can use blockchain to accurately and automatically record data, trusting that it cannot be altered by anyone. Data in these cases would be more transparent and actionable, allowing businesses to make more informed and strategic decisions.\n\nMany international businesses use blockchain solutions to make faster and cheaper cross-border payments. Using blockchain and cryptocurrency can reduce overall costs for enterprises, which can translate into lower costs for consumers.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlocks are files containing data and information about transactions and previous blocks. They are encrypted, proposed, and stored using various methods, but they are the basis for every blockchain.\n\nBlocks and blockchains are most commonly associated with cryptocurrency, but their eventual, hypothetical, and emerging uses in the world economy are what make them more interesting, especially for investors.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

    "summary": "Learn how to automate your smart contracts using Chainlink Automation with this step-by-step guide and open up a huge range of use cases.\n\n",
    "content": "Smart contracts are not self-executing, meaning they require an externally owned account, oracle, or contract to trigger their own functions. This creates a problem for many dApps that require their smart contracts to execute at regular time intervals (e.g. every 24 hours), when predefined conditions are met (e.g. Ethereum hitting a specific price), or following a computation (e.g. a loan is calculated to be undercollateralized).\n\nIn the past, developers would solve this problem by creating and maintaining their own centralized scripts to trigger their smart contracts, or trigger them manually. However, this effectively undermines the purpose of building a decentralized blockchain application, and opens up the possibility of downtime if the centralized script or manual triggering process fails.\n\nIn this tutorial you will learn how to use Chainlink Automation to trigger smart contract execution in a reliable, automatic, and decentralized manner.\n\nChainlink Automation unlocks a new way to trigger smart contract execution in a decentralized manner, enabling developers to transform the way they build and maintain dApps. There are three main benefits to decentralized smart contact automation.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to remove any centralized points of failure in your operations. Chainlink Automation is powered by a decentralized network of nodes—the same hyper-reliable nodes that currently secure tens of billions in value across DeFi via Chainlink Data Feeds—removing centralized points of failure.\n\nSecondly, rather than investing time and resources in creating scripts for on-chain monitoring and triggering smart contract execution, developers can plug into Chainlink Automation’s optimized infrastructure by simply creating an Automation-compatible contract and registering it. This saves time, reduces the DevOps workload, and allows developers to focus on writing more great code.\n\nLastly, by using Chainlink Automation, developers can enhance the security of their protocol. Developers no longer have to risk exposing their own private key when initiating transactions from centralized servers—the nodes on the Chainlink Automation Network will sign on-chain transactions.\n\nYou can automate your smart contracts with Chainlink Automation in two steps:After these steps have been completed, Chainlink Automation will perform the Upkeep job as specified without any further input.\n\nIf you are new to Solidity, we recommend following some of the beginner tutorials before continuing. This tutorial is particularly comprehensive and useful. We will now show you how to make your contract Automation-compatible. If you prefer watching a video on the topic please watch our video tutorial.\n\nTo create an automated trigger for smart contract execution, you need to write an Automation-compatible smart contract. Automation-compatible contracts have a checkUpkeep function and a performUpkeep function with the required inputs and outputs expected by Chainlink Automation. To help prevent errors we will use the Automation-compatible interface before we specify what our check and perform functions should do.\n\nStart by importing the KeeperCompatibleInterface into your contract.\n\nThere are two functions to this interface:Chainlink Automation uses a decentralized network to monitor the checkUpkeep function securely and cost-efficiently off-chain during every block and then initiates an on-chain transaction to execute the smart contract function when predefined conditions are met.\n\nThe checkUpkeep function takes a bytes parameter named checkData that is set when you register your Upkeep on the Automation app. This value is optional and can be used in your logic to determine if checkUpkeep returns true.\n\ncheckUpkeep returns a bool called upkeepNeeded. When true, this will call performUpkeep. It also returns performData in Bytes format (optional additional data) that the Automation Node should call performUpkeep with if Upkeep is needed. For more information, see the Developer Documentation.\n\nIf the off-chain simulation of your checkUpkeep confirms your predefined conditions are met (upkeepNeeded \u003d\u003d true from checkUpkeep), the Automation Node will broadcast a transaction to the blockchain executing the performUpkeep with performData as an input.\n\nA rotating node selection process prevents gas price auction wars between nodes and stabilizes costs of automating your contracts.\n\nHere is an example contract snippet from Chainlink Automation user Entropyfi where checkUpkeep checks whether the Entropyfi prediction game is due for settlement.\n\nChainlink Automation Nodes will constantly call the checkUpkeep function, and if the upkeepNeeded is evaluated to true, then the nodes will execute the performUpkeep function.\n\nWhether you are creating a new contract or already have a contract deployed that contains a function that needs to be automated there are guides to help you get started in the Chainlink Automation Developer Documentation.\n\nStart with the example contract here. The example below represents a simple counter contract.\n\nChainlink Automation can monitor the state of any on-chain or off-chain condition, such as the passage of time (e.g. did 24 hours pass?) or a computation (e.g. is the loan calculated to be undercollateralized?). Once a condition is met, Automation nodes submit a transaction on-chain to trigger the smart contract to execute.\n\nYou can also start with a Chainlink Automation utility contract such as the EthBalanceMonitor contract or these examples.\n\nOnce you have your Automation-compatible contract, head over to the Chainlink Automation app and click “Register new Upkeep”.\n\nFor a detailed step-by-step guide on how to register, see the Chainlink Developer Documentation.\n\nImportant note (for non-ETH chains): your Upkeep must be funded with ERC-677 LINK (not ERC-20, which is common across many token bridges). Use PegSwap to make your LINK tokens ERC-677 compatible.\n\nOnce registered and approved, you can add additional funds and see all the details for your Upkeep on the Chainlink Automation app.\n\nNow that you know how easy it is to automate your smart contracts with Chainlink Automation, you can get started with integrating Chainlink Automation and unlock a huge range of use cases, such as DEX limit orders, cross-chain NFT minting, rebasing and rebalancing tokens, and much more.\n\nLearn more by visiting the developer documentation and joining the technical discussion in Discord.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Nader Al-Naji was arrested on Saturday and faces both civil and criminal charges.\n\n",
    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice charged the founder of crypto social media platform BitClout with wire fraud and the sale of unregistered securities.\n\nAccording to court documents, Nader Al-Naji – known pseudonymously as “Diamondhands” – raised approximately $257 million from the sale of BitClout’s native token, BTCLT. Al-Naji led investors to believe that the money would be used to pay him and other BitClout employees, but instead spent “more than $7 million of investor funds on personal expenditures” including renting a mansion in Beverly Hills and giving family members “extravagant cash gifts,” an SEC press release said Tuesday.\n\nAl-Naji was arrested Saturday and presented to a magistrate judge in California on Monday, the DOJ said.\n\nThe SEC has accused Al-Naji of taking steps to make BitClout seem like a decentralized project with “no company behind it…just coins and code.” In addition to using a pseudonym, the SEC’s complaint pointed out that Al-Naji “allegedly secured a letter from a prominent law firm opining, based on his mischaracterizations of the nature of his project, that BTCLT were not likely to be deemed securities under federal law.”\n\n“As alleged in our complaint, Al-Naji attempted to evade the federal securities laws and defraud the investing public, mistakenly believing that ‘being \"fake\" decentralized generally confuses regulators and deters them from going after you,’” said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement in a press release. “He is obviously wrong: as we have shown time and again, and as reflected in the SEC’s detailed allegations here, we are guided by economic realities, not cosmetic labels. The dedicated staff of the SEC uncovered Al-Naji’s lies and will now hold him accountable for misleading investors.”\n\nSeveral members of Al-Naji’s family, including his wife and mother, are named as relief defendants for the investor funds transferred to them by Al-Naji in the SEC’s lawsuit.\n\nParallel criminal charges have been filed against Al-Naji by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. Al-Naji has been charged with one count of wire fraud for the BitClout scheme, a charge which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nBitClout, which launched in early 2021, was promoted as a proof-of-work blockchain designed to run – and monetize – social media.\n\nFrom the beginning, the project was controversial. Big names in the crypto space had profiles created for them without their consent, which included scraping and copying their Twitter profiles onto the BitClout site.\n\nShortly after BitClout’s rollout, law firm Anderson Kill, which has a prominent crypto practice, sent Al-Naji a cease-and-desist letter claiming that the project’s usage of social media users’ likenesses without their permission violated California’s Civil Code section 3344, which protects an individual\u0027s right to profit from the commercial value of his or her own identity and is established throughout the U.S. in both statute and common law.\n\nCritics also suggested that the BitClout model had a built-in incentive for “canceling” users. One blockchain researcher told CoinDesk in a 2021 interview that “people are incentivized to cancel people. All you have to do is open a short position and then try to mangle someone’s reputation.”\n\nIn addition to identity and reputational concerns, critics were also dismayed by the financial realities of the project – in order to do anything with their BitClout profiles, users needed to trade bitcoin for BTCLT. But because there was no way to trade BTCLT back to BTC on BitClout’s site, their money was essentially stuck on the platform.\n\nAccording to an interview with Al-Naji in 2021, investors in the project included Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Social Capital, TQ Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Winklevoss Capital, Arrington Capital, Polychain, Pantera, Digital Currency Group, Huobi, Variant and more.\n\nUPDATE (July 30, 2024 at 16:12 UTC): Adds more information on BitClout and its history.\n\n",

    "summary": "The CEO and founder of the analytics firm CryptoQuant has explained how this Bitcoin bull cycle could be probable to last till mid-2025.\n\n",
    "content": "The CEO and founder of the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has explained how this Bitcoin bull cycle could probably last till mid-2025.\n\nIn a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has discussed about a pattern that old whales have followed in terms of profit-taking during the past cycles.\n\n“Old whales take profits during bull markets,” notes Young Ju. “Their selling brings new capital into accumulation addresses, raising realized prices.” Accumulation Addresses refer to the Bitcoin wallets that have no history of selling.\n\nThese addresses also have a few other conditions, such as they must have at least two deposits and shouldn’t be connected to miners or centralized exchanges. They should also carry a balance of at least 10 BTC, and their last transaction should have been within the past seven years.\n\nThe Accumulation Addresses basically reflect the perennial HODLers of the market, who only buy more and never sell. During bull markets, as old whales break their silence to harvest their profits, demand from these HODLers absorbs the selling.\n\nTo display this trend, the CryptoQuant CEO has made use of the “Realized Price” metric, which keeps track of the cost basis of the average investor belonging to this cohort.\n\nWhen the value of this indicator is above the spot price of the cryptocurrency, it means the cohort as a whole is in a state of unrealized loss right now. On the other hand, it being under BTC’s value implies these diamond hands are currently carrying profits.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Realized Price for the Bitcoin Accumulation Addresses over the past decade:\n\nAs shown in the above graph, the Realized Price for this cohort observed a rise during the last two Bitcoin bull runs. This would suggest that these HODLers were buying as prices were going up, thus raising their average cost basis.\n\nThis accumulation likely corresponded to profit-taking from other entities in the market. As Young Ju has pointed out, this profit-taking spree lasted for about 18 months in these past cycles.\n\nFrom the chart, it’s visible that the indicator has once again started showing an uptrend with the price rally this year. This would suggest that the Accumulation Addresses are back to absorbing profit-taking from old whales.\n\nSo far, this rise has lasted for around four months, which means that there could still be around another fourteen months of it left, if the last two cycles are anything to go by. Based on this, the analyst thinks this latest Bitcoin bull cycle could end up running into mid-2025.\n\nBitcoin has edged close to the $70,000 level during the past day after observing a surge of around 3%.\n\n",

These two tokens are not just making headlines; they are creating real opportunities for massive gains. Let’s dive into why now is the perfect time to be bullish on Cardano (ADA) and Mpeppe.\n\nCardano (ADA) is currently priced at $0.411165 USD with a market cap of $14.76 billion USD. It has shown a modest increase of 0.62% in the last 24 hours, with a 24-hour trading volume of $305.26 million USD. But the excitement around Cardano isn’t just about these numbers.\n\nRecently, the Cardano (ADA) community has been buzzing with speculation about the possibility of an ADA-ETF.

    "content": "The Bank of England said it\u0027s planning a series of experiments with distributed ledger technology (DLT) and wholesale central bank digital currencies (wCBDC) to keep abreast of changes in the payments landscape and assess the opportunities and risks of developments in financial technology.\n\nThe rise of cryptocurrencies and the DLT that underpins them has prompted central banks across the globe to see how they can interact with both. Many are working separately, together or through the Bank for International Settlements – the umbrella organization for the world\u0027s central banks – on projects to explore the impact of developing technology on the world\u0027s monetary systems. The BOE, for example, is part of the BIS\u0027 Project Agora looking at testing exchanging tokenized commercial bank deposits and central bank money in multiple currencies on a single platform among seven banks.\n\nOne way that central bank money can interact with distributed ledger platforms is so-called synchronization, the report said. That\u0027s when an asset is transferred from one platform to another – possibly including one based on DLT – with the cash leg of the transaction on the bank\u0027s Real Time Gross Settlement ledger.\n\n“Confidence in money and payments is fundamental to the Bank’s responsibility for monetary and financial stability,\" Governor Andrew Bailey said in the introduction to a discussion paper on Tuesday. \"As innovation in this space continues, our role must also evolve, to support a robust and dynamic U.K. economy.\"\n\nWholesale CBDCs, digital tokens issued by central banks that are used only by institutions, could help interactions with programmable platforms, the discussion paper noted.\n\n\"Our programme of experiments would be grounded in a set of policy outcomes which we seek from innovations in wholesale central bank money,\" the bank said in the paper. \"The programme would cover both wCBDC and synchronisation, as well as the relative merits of these two approaches.\"\n\nThe bank said it will work with the Treasury, Payments Systems Regulator and the Financial Conduct Authority to also ensure the singleness of money is maintained even when stablecoins are involved. That is, making sure all forms of money – cash, bank deposits and so on – are interchangeable with each other.\n\nIn the discussion paper, the bank said it will carry out a series of experiments to ensure that the singleness of money is maintained between stablecoins and tokenized deposits, which are deposit claims represented on programmable platforms.\n\n\"We should consider applying new tokenization technology to conventional money, rather than in the crypto asset markets where they were first employed,\" Sarah Breeden, a deputy governor of the Bank of England, wrote on Tuesday in the Financial Times.\n\nRead more: UK Financial Watchdogs Publish Plans to Regulate Stablecoins\n\nUPDATE (JULY 30 13:55 UTC): Adds deputy governor\u0027s comments in Financial Times in final paragraph.\n\n\n\n",

    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "Chainlink is a highly flexible oracle framework that provides developers the tools required to build a wide range of smart contract applications.\n\n",
    "content": "Fundamentally, contracts define the terms and obligations for an exchange of value between two or more independent parties. Historically, a centralized arbitrator is usually required to verify if those terms and conditions are met. However, thanks to the advent of blockchain technology and smart contract applications, we can now replace centralized arbitrators with decentralized infrastructure, reducing counterparty risk and improving operational efficiency.\n\nHowever, due to the consensus mechanisms of blockchains, smart contracts have no built-in capabilities for interacting with external resources like data providers and API services as a means of verifying the outcome of real-world events happening outside the blockchain. This creates what is known as the blockchain oracle problem and represents one of the greatest limitations to representing everyday contracts on the blockchain.\n\nTo overcome this lack of connectivity, hybrid smart contracts use oracles as middleware to retrieve external data inputs, push data outputs to external systems, and perform scalable off-chain computations. Not only do oracles serve as a two-way bridge between smart contracts and the outside world, but they also provide a security framework for protecting against any single point of failure such as data manipulation and downtime.\n\nChainlink is the most widely used decentralized oracle network, currently securing tens of billions in USD value for live applications across numerous blockchains and use cases. Chainlink is not a single oracle network but an ecosystem consisting of numerous decentralized oracle networks running in parallel. Each oracle network can provide a multitude of oracle services without cross dependencies on other oracle networks, some of which include:Ultimately, Chainlink provides the necessary developer tools required to construct any type of oracle network, such as using multiple data sources, multiple oracle nodes, various aggregation methods, payment penalties, reputation services, and visualization tools. This allows for a wide range of use cases to be developed, tested, and pushed into production.\n\nAccess to external data opens up a whole new wave of functionality for smart contracts. To inspire you with the limitless potential of universally connected smart contracts, we put together a list of 77+ ways to use the Chainlink Network. If any of these ideas resonate with you or if you want to learn more, find us on Discord or Github, and check out our documentation to begin building universally connected smart contracts today.\n\nMoney is the common medium used today to value and exchange assets. Financial products provide different vehicles in which people can maximize the value of their money via different strategies like hedging, speculating, earning interest, collateralizing loans, and more. However, traditional finance is often gated, wherein well-capitalized entities have disproportionate control over the issuance of money and the creation/offering and settlement of financial products. The result is a lack of universal accessibility to certain financial products and the introduction of counterparty risk, where the larger entity has more influence on whether the financial product is fairly honored according to the pre-agreed upon terms.\n\nBlockchains and smart contracts bring deterministic execution to financial products, eliminate moats around financial product creation, and provide tamper-proof monetary policy for on-chain assets. Chainlink oracles play a critical role in creating advanced smart contracts representing financial products and monetary instruments, particularly those that execute based on market data like FX rates, interest rates, asset prices, indices, and more.\n\nBlockchain-based money markets are crucial financial infrastructure that use smart contracts to connect lenders, who wish to earn yield on their assets, with borrowers, who wish to gain access to working capital. They allow users to increase the utility of their crypto holdings and participate in both the supply side and the demand side. However, to ensure the solvency of the platform, price feeds are required to track the valuation of assets used on the platform as a means of ensuring loans are issued at fair market prices and liquidations automatically occur on undercollateralized loans.\n\nAave, Compound, and Liquity are examples of on-chain money markets protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to fetch market data for dozens of different on-chain cryptocurrencies. With this real-time pricing data, these lending/borrowing protocols can calculate the valuation of each user’s collateral and debt in order to determine when liquidations should be initiated. This ensures the money market protocols are always sufficiently collateralized, protecting tens of billions of USD value in user deposits.\n\nStablecoins are on-chain tokens that are pegged 1:1 to fiat currency, commonly the US dollar. They provide users with the ability to hold a non-volatile cryptocurrency. While centralized stablecoins are backed by fiat in an off-chain bank account, decentralized stablecoins are commonly overcollateralized by on-chain cryptocurrencies and require price data to maintain full collateralization (e.g. a user’s collateral is worth over 150% the value of their loan).\n\nDeFiDollar is an example of a decentralized meta-stablecoin (a stablecoin backed by multiple stablecoins) that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to track the price of the underlying assets including sUSD, USDT, DAI, and USDC. In the event that one or multiple of these tokens deviate from their 1:1 USD peg, thus causing DUSD to also lose its peg, a rebalance is triggered between the four reserves in order to preserve the dollar parity of DUSD.\n\nSimilar to centralized stablecoins collateralized by dollars in a bank account or decentralized stablecoins overcollateralized by on-chain cryptocurrency, algorithmic stablecoins aim to maintain a peg equivalent to another currency like USD. However, unlike other implementations, algorithmic stablecoins maintain their peg using automated rewards and penalties to drive the price towards the peg, often by burning the stablecoin when under its peg (deflation) and minting more stablecoins when over its peg (inflation).\n\nFei Protocol is an example of an algorithmic stablecoin that uses Chainlink Price Feeds as the reference to set the protocol-controlled value bonding curve for the FEI/ETH liquidity pool on Uniswap to stabilize the peg of the FEI token. Through the market-wide pricing provided by the ETH/USD Price Feed, Fei Protocol can ensure the proper exchange rate is offered by the bonding curve.\n\nFutures are financial instruments that “obligate” traders to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. Commonly used for hedging and leveraged exposure, futures smart contracts require users to collateralize their long or short position. Price feeds are used to determine whether or not liquidations should occur, ensuring each contract is fully collateralized at all times.\n\nLyra and MCDEX are examples of on-chain financial applications that utilize Chainlink Price Feeds in order to power Perpetual Contracts, which is a Futures contract without expiry. By using Chainlink oracles, these protocols are able to ensure the solvency of their platform by having access to real-time price data for both determining when liquidations should occur and dynamically setting the funding rate to maintain net neutral exposure.\n\nSimilar to futures contracts, options are a type of financial derivative that grant traders the “option” to buy or sell a certain amount of a particular asset by a future date if they so choose. In the off-chain world, centralized entities most frequently underwrite the contracts, but on the blockchain, decentralized peer-to-peer options are possible.\n\nOpyn and Thales are examples of options protocols that use Chainlink Price Feeds to calculate the valuation of crypto assets, enabling users to mint, trade, and settle options contracts. Additionally, Chainlink oracle nodes like dxFeed provide Implied Volatility (IV) data on various crypto assets, granting contract creators the ability to calculate an option’s contract premium in a reliable and tamper-resistant manner.\n\nSynthetic assets are a category of financial instruments that provide traders price exposure to specific assets, such as indices or commodities, without requiring ownership of the physical asset itself. Smart contract-based synthetic assets allow traders to create advanced non-custodial trading strategies and gain exposure to traditional assets that do not exist on the blockchain.\n\nSynthetix is an example of a protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to enable the minting of various “synths” that allow traders to gain on-chain exposure to assets like cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, commodities, indices, equities, and more. Through a peer-to-contract trading model, users are able to swap between these synthetic tokens with zero slippage using Chainlink Price Feeds to access the current value of the underlying assets.\n\nCredit Default Swaps (CDS) are financial agreements that allow lenders to hedge against the possible occurrence of a default (lack of payment) from a borrower. If the borrower goes into default, the party who issued and sold the Credit Default Swap reimburses the lender for the outstanding funds not paid by the borrower.\n\nOpium.Exchange is an example of an on-chain protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to settle various financial instrument products. One of these products includes a Credit Default Swap on the centralized stablecoin USDT Tether, allowing traders to hedge against Tether deviating and falling below its $1 peg.\n\nBonds are a financial agreement that enables the raising of short-term capital by issuing debt to be paid back at a later date. Traditional bond contracts can be replicated as an automated smart contract through the use of Chainlink oracles, which provide the data required for settlement such as interest rates, debt scores, fiat payments, and more.\n\nChainlink has already demonstrated such capability with a POC with SWIFT, where oracles were used to aggregate interest rates from five major banks, fetch debt score data from S\u0026P, and generate an interest payment in the form of an ISO20022 SWIFT payment message. As a multi-trillion dollar industry, bringing bonds onto the blockchain can greatly reduce counterparty risk and lower operational costs across the board.\n\nA unique use case for smart contracts is non-custodial “smart portfolios” that automatically rebalance user portfolios by executing trades on their behalf based on preset conditions. This provides users with advanced financial products that programmatically manage investments based on the current market-wide price of specific assets and tokens. These trading strategies can be tokenized, allowing users to transfer and use these tokens within other smart contract applications.\n\nTokensets is one such example of a protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to generate various “Sets,” tokenized positions that execute trades on the behalf of users. These Sets are based on Technical Analysis (TA) metrics such as the RSI or moving averages, designed to catch key price action trends. Additionally, users can use their Set tokens as collateral within other protocols, such as the Aave money market, to gain additional capital efficiency.\n\nWrapped cross-chain assets—cryptocurrencies/tokens native to one blockchain that are locked into a contract and then “unlocked” on another blockchain—are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to increase the collateral types available within the DeFi ecosystem. However, in order to ensure the integrity of DeFi applications supporting wrapped asset deposits, Proof of Reserve reference contracts can be used to supply data regarding the true collateralization of these on-chain assets.\n\nTwo protocols using Chainlink to power Proof of Reserve reference feeds include BitGo’s WBTC and Ren Protocol’s renBTC, representing a large majority of the wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum and representing billions in USD value. These Proof of Reserve reference feeds provide DeFi protocols with the data they need to autonomously verify collateral reserves and swiftly protect user funds during an undercollateralization event. Proof of Reserve reference feeds can also be used to track the collateralization of assets beyond cross-chain tokens including stablecoins and real-world commodities, further increasing the collateral available within DeFi.\n\nBringing real-world assets onto the blockchain provides a large potential to expand the economic activity of DeFi, as seen with the adoption of fiat-backed stablecoins. However, this requires the underlying collateral to be held by a central custodian, disconnecting the on-chain tokenized representation from the actual off-chain asset itself. Through Chainlink Proof of Reserve, smart contacts are able to autonomously audit the collateralization of real-world asset-backed tokens, protecting users during black swan events.\n\nExamples of this are the Paxos Proof of Reserve for PAX and PAXG as well as the TrustToken Proof of Reserve for TUSD. The latter provides DeFi applications with data regarding the true amount of US dollars backing the stablecoin TUSD held by TrustToken’s off-chain escrowed bank accounts as reviewed by Armanino, an independent top-25 auditing firm in the United States. This collateralization data can be checked against the total amount of circulating TUSD tokens on various blockchains, as reported by the complementary TUSD Proof of Supply feed, to determine the collateralization of TrustToken’s tokenized USD.\n\nSmart contracts can be used to automatically execute trading strategies at predetermined intervals. However, a range of variables can influence the profitability of those strategies, specifically network gas costs. Thus, traders using automated systems need reliable data from oracles in order to ensure that their trades will be consistently profitable.\n\nPickle Finance is using Chainlink Automation in its Pickle Jars product to help automatically manage capital-efficient LP positions across Uniswap v3. By automatically rebalancing users’ LP positions, Chainlink Automation helps ensure the positions remain in range and collect maximum LP fees—helping maximize returns for users.\n\nAs an increasing number of DeFi products launch with DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) governance, there becomes more of a need for developers and community members to distribute the revenue generated by a DeFi protocol in a decentralized and real-time manner. Through the usage of Chainlink oracles, DAOs can distribute crypto revenues proportionally according to various metrics, such as staked coins, governance participation, developer activity, or any customized set of requirements.\n\nSynthetix is one example of a DeFi protocol that will use Chainlink Automation to trigger the distribution of exchange fees and staking rewards each week to users. Chainlink Automation will monitor the smart contract’s state off-chain and autonomously call the fee distribution function in the protocol’s feePools smart contract after the fee period duration has ended.\n\nYield Farming is a new financial primitive within the DeFi ecosystem that is used to bootstrap liquidity and facilitate the fair distribution of a protocol’s governance tokens. In most yield farming applications, users who provide liquidity to a protocol are granted a reward in the form of its native governance token, serving as a growth subsidy.\n\nTwo protocols using Chainlink oracles in their yield farming mechanisms are Plasm and StrongBlock. Plasm uses Chainlink price oracles to help determine the amount of value users have locked into the protocol and then distributes rewards accordingly, while StrongBlock calculates the USD value locked in Community pools once every 24 hours.\n\nYield optimizing protocols automatically harvest and compound yield for their users. Users deposit tokens into a vault that automatically harvests yield at critical points to maximize compounding returns. However, as smart contracts cannot execute their own functions, yield optimizers need an external entity to trigger an on-chain transaction. Instead of depending on unreliable public bounties or centralized bots with a single point of failure to automate transactions, many yield optimizers use a trust-minimized solution.\n\nChainlink Automation enables developers to trigger smart contracts in a highly reliable, cost-efficient, and decentralized manner, and has already powered tens of thousands of automated transactions across Web3. Developers can set them to autocompound yield at regular periods or build advanced optimization strategies that only execute when it’s profitable to do so.\n\nFor example, the yield optimizer Pickle Finance is using Chainlink Automation to help yield aggregators build more advanced, fully automated vault strategies. With Chainlink Automation, Pickle Finance is able to increase rewards for depositors without relying on manual intervention or introducing a single point of failure would make its platform vulnerable to manipulation and technical failures. See how you can get started with Chainlink Automation or explore the docs.\n\nUsers can increase their yield and capital efficiency by using leveraged yield farming protocols that lend depositors capital through protocol-controlled undercollateralized loans. With these positions, borrowers can maximize the value of their assets through various yield farming strategies while lenders earn a passive income from borrowers who want to amplify their farming positions. This results in an application-specific money market specially focused around the activity of yield farming.\n\nAlpaca Finance is one example of a protocol using Chainlink Price Feeds to enable users to leverage up their positions on PancakeSwap and WaultSwap by borrowing capital to increase their positions. Financial market data from Price Feeds is used to calculate proper collateralization ratios during loan issuance and liquidate positions to ensure the long-term solvency of the protocol, even during market volatility in the valuation of the collateral deposited by borrowers.\n\nAs the DeFi ecosystem continues to expand across a number of blockchain networks, the opportunity for generating yield from existing protocols like Aave will fractionalize across disconnected environments. In order to overcome this issue, a cross-chain token bridge is required to facilitate the transfer of user funds across networks. However, existing cross-chain solutions are vulnerable to exploitation, with hundreds of millions of dollars already having been siphoned from such protocols. The Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), a secure open-source standard for transferring messages and tokens across blockchain networks, overcomes these issues and will provide developers with the tamper-resistant infrastructure required to create multi-chain yield earning platforms.\n\nAs a new DeFi-enabled financial primitive, self-paying loan protocols enable users to deposit assets as collateral and borrow/mint synthetic assets to provide working capital. The deposited collateral is routed to a yield-generating protocol, where the yield is used to automatically pay down the debt over time, creating a highly capital-efficient borrowing position.\n\nOne implementation of this new financial primitive is Alchemix, a self-paying loan protocol that uses Chainlink Automation to provide users an advance on their future yield over time for deposits of DAI and ETH. Automation is used to trigger vault harvesting and vault flushing each day, automating debt repayment and reallocating new depositing into Yearn Finance to generate yield.\n\nIn certain instances of exceptionally high volatility, the prices for assets on a cryptocurrency exchange may cease to reflect the prices seen on the wider market. This can lead to a loss of funds to arbitrageurs, or to users getting wrongly liquidated due to leveraged positions they had open. Such occurrences can reduce user trust in an exchange. Exchanges can benefit from using a circuit breaker that trips should certain deviations occur.\n\nDigitex is an example of a traditional exchange that protects users from market manipulation by monitoring for deviation between their internal price feeds and Chainlink Price Feeds as an additional layer of security for users trading on the platform. If the exchange’s price deviates beyond a certain percentage from the wider market price reported by Chainlink oracles, a “circuit breaker” can be triggered to temporarily halt trading and liquidations.\n\nDecentralized exchanges (DEXs) are on-chain trading venues that allow users to trade cryptocurrencies without taking custody of those assets or giving out personal information to a centralized institution. As DEXs grow in popularity, the desire for traditional trading strategies and advanced features currently available on traditional centralized exchanges grows in importance.\n\n0x Relayer Bamboo Relay is an example of a decentralized exchange that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to power stop-loss order functionalities—conditional trading functions based on the price action of an asset. With aggregated market data from Chainlink, each trader’s stop-loss order will only be executed when the market-wide price of the asset surpasses a certain predefined threshold, preventing market manipulation attacks from falsely executing trades.\n\nAutomated Market Makers (AMMs) are an increasingly popular category of decentralized exchanges. Instead of traditional order books, AMMs are on-chain liquidity pools that facilitate asset swaps based on a predetermined price formula. By pooling capital, liquidity providers are able to earn passive yield and traders gain access to on-demand liquidity.\n\nDODO is an example of an AMM protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to power a new AMM design known as a Proactive Market Maker. DODO’s PMM mimics human market-making behaviors and gathers more capital near the market price reported by Chainlink in order to facilitate more efficient and frequent trading.\n\nMany protocols rely on some form of staking—the locking of cryptocurrency collateral into a smart contract—in order to secure their crypto-economic networks. Staked collateral might help signal where rewards should be proportionally distributed, or it can be “slashed”—programmatically taken under certain conditions as a means of disincentivizing malicious behaviors.\n\nFor instance, AdEx requires its validator nodes to stake collateral and maintain high availability. AdEx uses Chainlink oracles to monitor node uptime and trigger the slashing of collateral should any node fall below the uptime requirements. This ensures that only high-quality node operators participate in the network, which in turn enhances the security of the entire platform.\n\nRebasing is a new financial primitive within DeFi that involves the act of adjusting the supply of a token as a means to maintain its peg to a specific reference asset, such as the US dollar. If the price of the token is above its peg during the rebase, then more tokens are minted and given proportionally to all token holders with the goal of lowering the per token price. Conversely, if the price of the token is below the peg, then a certain percentage of each holder’s tokens are burned to raise the per token price.\n\nAmpleforth is an example of a protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to power its native rebasing functionality. The total supply of AMPL is rebased on a daily basis to track the current Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate, an index from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on the current value of the inflation-adjusted 2019 US dollar. Both the volume-weighted average price of AMPL and the CPI index are provided to the Ampleforth protocol by Chainlink oracles.\n\nAs discussed in our recent education piece, tokenized real-world assets are among the most promising use cases for blockchain and smart contract technology. They take real-world assets and represent them on the blockchain as a token. Compared to traditional assets, tokenized assets benefit from global accessibility, permissionless liquidity, on-chain transparency, and reduced transactional friction.\n\nBlockchain money markets are commonly overcollateralized to ensure user loans can be properly liquidated when the collateral drops in value and/or the debt rises in value, thereby keeping user funds in the market safe. However, because smart contracts are “asleep” by default, liquidations need to be performed by an external party to “wake up” the contract to close a position by paying down the debt. The process needs to be highly reliable to ensure no toxic loan positions on created and left open.\n\nAave is one example of a money market protocol with tens of billions of dollars in user deposits that will use Chainlink Automation to help trigger the liquidation of user positions. Chainlink Automation will monitor the collateralization ratio of user positions, and if any position falls below the predefined threshold of the collateral (e.g. 150%), the decentralized Chainlink Automation Network will call the liquidation function and close the position, even during heavy market volatility and blockchain network congestion.\n\nIt’s easy for smart contracts to issue payments in the cryptocurrency of their native blockchain, such as Ethereum smart contracts issuing payments in ETH, for example. However, many businesses can’t afford the risk of holding volatile cryptocurrency assets on their balance sheet. They also don’t want the additional friction of trading out cryptocurrency for their preferred fiat currency. Given the wide variety of payment preferences around the world, smart contracts need access to many types of payment options to adequately service global demand. Chainlink can facilitate a wide variety of payment services thanks to its ability to push outputs from smart contracts to external APIs.\n\nChainlink enables smart contracts to connect to existing banking systems, allowing smart contract developers to seamlessly integrate information and services such as consumer bank accounts, direct deposit, and other processes from leading global banks.\n\nMany consumer applications such as Uber and AirBnB offer popular retail payments to users. Chainlink can bring the same ease of use to smart contracts by giving them access to leading credit card providers and established payment networks, like PayPal and Stripe. Developers can start building applications that take advantage of the most in-demand payment outputs, both domestically and internationally, used on a daily basis in the retail economy. Chainlink already has pre-built modular external adapters for popular retail payment rails such as PayPal and Mistertango.\n\nCryptocurrency is becoming increasingly popular, but some of the popular choices are often disconnected from the leading smart contract platforms. Chainlink bridges the gap by allowing any smart contract platform to make payments on any other distributed ledger, such as Bitcoin payments triggered from the Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, Chainlink Price Feeds can be used to provide exchange rates at the time of transfer or point of sale, ensuring users get fair market rates in a tamper-proof manner.\n\nAlchemy and Paycoin are examples of hybrid crypto/fiat payment platforms that will use Chainlink Price Feeds to determine exchange rates, allowing users to pay with a wide range of cryptocurrencies while the merchant still receives their preferred form of payment.\n\nOne significant source of inefficiency across nearly all industries in the legacy world is the delay in payments for services rendered to employees and contractors. Chainlink-powered smart contracts can be used to programmatically distribute payments to workers in real-time, which would reduce accounting overhead costs for employers, as well as providing access to earned wages for workers on a more immediate basis.\n\nFiat on/off-ramp aggregator Transak laid out how this could work by using a work tracking API like WakaTime to trigger payments to developers on a regular basis. Additionally, Chainlink Price Feeds can be used to calculate the exact amount of crypto revenue to distribute, maintaining a certain USD value per payout.\n\nRemittances are quite common in an increasingly globalized world. However, despite advancements in technology, it’s a slow and expensive industry. Many DLT projects are aiming to disrupt the remittance industry and Chainlink oracles can provide reliable data on foreign exchange rates to smart contracts as well as enable direct deposit upon transfer.\n\nBlockchain technology can replace backend processes across the financial system with modern digitized solutions. Through the automation of backend processes and syncing multiple ledgers of record, financial service providers can substantially reduce risk and enhance capital efficiency.\n\nBringing real-world assets onchain—from currencies to stocks to bonds to real estate to gold—unlocks opportunities to increase investor access, enhance transparency, and strengthen market liquidity. Santander has reported that blockchain technology could help reduce banks’ infrastructure costs by $15-20B annually through the automation of backend office operations.\n\nHaving high-quality, reliable data about the market price delivered onchain by Chainlink Price Feeds is essential for the creation of high-integrity markets for tokenized assets. For example, the PAXG Chainlink Price Feed—a tokenized gold token redeemable for one fine troy ounce of gold—enables secure markets to be built around physical gold. Additionally, Paxos uses Chainlink Proof of Reserve to enable onchain verifications that their tokenized gold products are fully backed by gold reserves custodied offchain.\n\nTo help bring capital markets onchain, Chainlink is working with The Depository Trust \u0026 Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world’s largest securities settlement system processing $2+ quadrillion annually. DTCC is exploring how Chainlink CCIP can unlock tokenized asset interoperability. Additionally, as part of a previous collaboration with Swift and Chainlink, DTCC minted and issued “BondTokens” compatible with CCIP and distributed them onchain to Swift’s designated test wallets.\n\nCCIP enables the secure transfer of arbitrary data, tokens, and instructions between public and private blockchains. As the financial system increasingly moves assets onchain, CCIP can help securely transfer tokenized assets cross-chain, increasing access to the financial system for developing countries, enabling the creation of innovative new financial instruments, and enhancing liquidity for global markets.\n\nSwift and Chainlink, along with 12+ world-leading financial institutions, including DTCC, Euroclear, Clearstream, ANZ Bank, Citi, BNY Mellon, BNP Paribas, Lloyds Banking Group, and SDX, successfully demonstrated a secure and scalable way to transfer tokenized assets cross-chain using CCIP and financial institutions’ existing backend infrastructure.\n\n“The collaboration between Swift, Chainlink, and the financial community represents significant progress towards enabling interoperability between traditional financial systems and emerging blockchain networks […] By leveraging existing Swift infrastructure and Chainlink CCIP, the collaboration demonstrated the ability to transfer tokenised value efficiently and securely across public and private blockchains, using standardised messaging formats and proven business processes.”—SwiftCorporate action errors cost 70% of market participants more than $2M in 2020, of which 56% were due to data issues.\n\nBlockchains create a shared source of truth or “golden record” that aligns various stakeholders around an immutable source of hyper-reliable corporate action data. This helps mitigate costly errors and removes the need for downstream stakeholders in corporate processes, such as the custodian, to recheck the accuracy of key data from multiple sources.\n\nHaving this golden record onchain along with high-quality data and computation delivered onchain by Chainlink enables various corporate actions to be automated with smart contracts, reducing operational costs and shortening processing times. For example, a tokenized bond could have predetermined coupon payments embedded within the digital asset at the point of issuance.\n\nExamples of corporate actions that can benefit from blockchain technology include:Chainlink CCIP provides financial institutions with the ability to trade and settle tokenized assets across public and private blockchains, unlocking onchain DvP and atomic settlement for capital markets.\n\nFor example, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ), the largest institutional bank in Australia with over $1 trillion in assets under management, worked with Chainlink to demonstrate cross-chain tokenized asset settlement transactions using CCIP and ANZ-issued stablecoins and tokenized assets.\n\n“The value and the message moving together is revolutionary. That’s a real breakthrough.”—Nigel Dobson, Banking Services Lead at ANZ, at Sibos 2023While DeFi is currently the largest smart contract market, developers are increasingly building fraudproof, crypto-economically incentivized gaming applications. One of the unique characteristics of blockchain games is their ability to generate rare tokenized in-game items (mostly as NFTs), as the blockchain provides definite proof of the item’s rarity. Minting these rare items in a manner that the external entities or the game’s developers can manipulate to their own advantage is key to ensuring their value, which is why Chainlink developed a Verifiable Randomness Function (VRF). Chainlink VRF is a secure and provably fair source of Random Number Generation (RNG), which generates on-chain cryptographic proofs to prove to users that the randomness was not tampered with.\n\nTheir provably fair form of randomness brings reliability to the rarity of items, opening up things like virtual metaverses, where tokenized items can be reliably used across different games. Verifiable randomness is also critical to creating unquestioned fairness to regulated gambling applications, removing the need to trust that the house is telling the truth about their odds. Additionally, Chainlink VRF can order participants for in-demand giveaways and events or fairly select participants for low-demand events like jury duty in an unbiased manner. Beyond randomness, gaming can benefit from numerous data sets, such as real-world event data to augment in-game functions/ratings, exchange rates to facilitate NFT markets, IoT data to connect the physical world on-chain, and much more.\n\nIn-game items are a critical component of most games, as they provide users with special powers or unique attributes. Many in-game items are issued as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a token that is unique and not interchangeable. Chainlink VRF is already playing an important role in generating provably random NFTs and creating NFT attributes as rewards for different predefined in-game achievements, such as earning a rare skin for finishing in the top 10.\n\nAavegotchi is an example of an on-chain gaming project on the Polygon sidechain that used Chainlink VRF to quickly and efficiently mint provably rare Aavegotchi NFTs with randomly selected attributes when players opened Portals. Another example is Ether Legends, a digital collectible trading card game that uses Chainlink VRF to randomly distribute rare crypto-backed NFT prizes to top-tier players at the end of a season. Popular gaming dApp Axie Infinity also recently announced that it is using Chainlink VRF to generate provably random traits for Origin Axies within the game’s digital pet universe.\n\nDynamic NFTs expand upon the concept of NFTs by enabling such tokens to evolve and change over time as determined by real-world events or verifiable randomness delivered by Chainlink oracles. Compared to static NFTs, which do not change after minting, dynamic NFTs can change in rarity and utility over time, providing a gamified experience to collecting NFTs.\n\nMLB star Trey Mancini and NBA Rookie of the Year LaMelo Ball are two examples of athletes who have minted Dynamic NFTs powered by Chainlink oracles on the Ethereum blockchain. With the former, the NFTs are represented as limited-edition digital baseball cards that use Chainlink VRF to assign special utility to NFTs in a verifiably fair and unbiased manner, with all NFT sale proceeds going to cancer research. For the latter, the NFTs upgrade over time according to the player’s performance in the real world, where the EVOLVE tokens were activated when LaMelo Ball was selected as the NBA Rookie of the Year.\n\nUnpredictability is one of the hallmarks of fun games. The excitement of not knowing the next stage or what will happen around the corner creates suspense, intrigue, and challenge. Developers can leverage Chainlink VRF to ensure the integrity of unpredictable events. Some of these gameplay scenarios may include map generation, critical hits (battling games), matchmaking (multiplayer games), card draw order, and random encounters/events.\n\nBlockchain prediction markets enable individuals to bet on the outcome of specific real-world events. Due to their very nature, blockchain-based prediction markets, are reliant on external data to settle outcomes. Chainlink Data Feeds provide a decentralized, tamper-resistant source of external data that can be used to trigger the settlement of prediction markets as well as payment to the winners. Prediction markets have been created around sporting events results, political election outcomes, and cryptocurrency roadmap completions and price predictions, but ultimately prediction markets can encompass any type of wager as long as there are takers on the other side.\n\nAlong with Chainlink Data Feeds, Chainlink Automation is increasingly playing a key role in enhancing the security and decentralization of prediction markets. Instead of relying on DevOps teams, centralized automation bots like cron jobs, or incentive bounties to start and stop each prediction round and select the winner, Chainlink Automation can automate smart contract functions by triggering smart contracts in a highly reliable, cost-efficient, and decentralized manner. Learn more in the Chainlink Automation developer documentation.\n\nNot only does Chainlink Automation save developers hundreds of hours, it also significantly enhances the security of prediction markets. By integrating Chainlink Automation into their prediction games to help start and stop prediction rounds and distribute rewards to winners, Entropyfi eliminated a single point of failure and was able to save 20 engineering hours per week.\n\nEveripedia, a blockchain-based encyclopedia, recently used Chainlink to relay election results on-chain to help settle prediction markets. Everipedia operates a Chainlink oracle node and delivered cryptographically signed data from The Associated Press regarding the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election onto the Ethereum blockchain, where Chainlink Data Feeds were then used by on-chain prediction markets such as YieldWars.\n\nGameFi is a subsection of blockchain-based gaming. GameFi games enable players to earn in-game rewards. As its name suggests, GameFi lies at the intersection of blockchain-based gaming and decentralized finance. By offering economic incentives, developers can create an engaging gaming experience that encourages players to participate in the game’s ecosystem.\n\nOn GameFi platforms, players can earn rewards by progressing through the game, battling other players, and completing special tasks. Rewards include in-game tokens and NFTs representing weapons, skins, avatars, and virtual land, which can then be traded or sold on secondary markets, such as decentralized exchanges or NFT marketplaces. Non-custodial ownership gives players full control over their in-game assets, potentially enabling users to take their NFTs to other games and metaverses in the future.\n\nAutomation is essential for developing advanced GameFi experiences. Developers need to automate smart contract functions to start and end game rounds on time, distribute rewards to players based on particular game outcomes, and much more. While developers could automate these processes using scripts on a centralized server, this would consume valuable time and create a single point of failure that could lead to exploits and reliability issues. In contrast, by using Chainlink Automation, developers can trigger smart contract functions in a highly reliable, cost-efficient, and decentralized manner.\n\nFor example, the gamified NFT platform Nifty Royale is using Chainlink Automation to help trigger its NFT-based battle royale games. Specifically, Nifty Royale is using Automation to trigger the smart contract functions that start and end each round of its battle royale. By using Automation, Nifty Royale is increasing the security and reliability guarantees of its game, which is especially important as players can win in-game assets that have real-world value. If you want to take advantage of Chainlink Automation in your own GameFi project, explore the docs now.\n\nAdvancements in DeFi composability have led to innovative applications such as no-loss savings games—dApps which pool user deposits and lend them out on a decentralized money market in order to accrue interest. After a specified time frame, a winner is selected, earning all the accumulated interest from the pool. After the winner is chosen, all users are able to withdraw their original deposit without any loss.\n\nAn example of this is PoolTogether, an on-chain no-loss savings game that uses Chainlink VRF to select the winner of each prize. By utilizing a transparent and verifiable source of on-chain randomness, users are provided a higher degree of trust in the overall reliability and fairness of the no-loss prize pool platform.\n\nSmart contracts provide integrity to the execution of an online sports bet, while Chainlink decentralized oracle networks can verify sporting outcomes by aggregating data from reliable web APIs. These smart contracts (usually in the form of prediction markets) can be based on a match’s result, individual performances, or even something as seemingly inconsequential as a game’s opening coin toss. On top of that, it’s possible for eSports prediction markets to retrieve gaming data and broadcast it on-chain to determine the winners.\n\nOne example of a blockchain-based sports betting market is Augur, which uses Chainlink oracles on the high-throughput Polygon sidechain to power its Turbo prediction markets. Users can speculate on the outcome of a wide range of topics including different sports events in the NBA, MLB, MMA, and Olympics that are rapidly settled after a market closes using decentralized oracle networks that provide premium real-world data.\n\nThe insurance industry today operates in a low-trust business environment. Policyholders have an incentive to falsely report positive metrics in insurance applications to reduce their monthly deductibles and insurers have an incentive to delay payments and raise rates to account for misrepresented risk profiles. Since insurance companies are responsible for processing claims and are much more capitalized than policyholders, they wield substantially more power in terms of when and how claims are settled. Chainlink-powered smart contracts shift insurance contracts towards a more objective, equal-standing model where data directly determines the outcomes and execution is deterministic, without tampering by either party.\n\nTraditional insurance firms can leverage the benefits of blockchain technology by creating advanced smart contract-based parametric insurance agreements that automatically trigger payouts based on real-world data as delivered by decentralized oracle networks. By reducing reliance on manual arbitration and mitigating delayed payments as a result, coverage can be provided to a broader range of businesses to hedge a wide range of risks that exist in the real world.\n\nCrop insurance has long been considered an especially promising use case for smart contracts as it provides farmers in developing nations with insurance which they otherwise could not get access to or don’t trust due to underdeveloped local insurance markets. By providing anyone with an Internet connection the ability to hedge against unforeseen weather conditions, farmers all over the world are able to maintain their livelihood without the concern that one bad weather season could cause financial ruin.\n\nOne example of this is Arbol, a smart contract-based weather coverage solution that uses Chainlink oracles to fetch rainfall datasets from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This data is used to settle parametric crop insurance contracts that provide coverage based on the amount of rainfall in the region.\n\nOne of the earliest forms of smart contract insurance to reach production is flight insurance. Due to a range of uncontrollable variables such as weather and maintenance, flights are often delayed, leading to inconveniences for business travelers. Flight insurance policies allow travelers to mitigate these opportunity costs, as they pay out compensation in the event of a delay.\n\nOne example is Etherisc, a decentralized insurance protocol that leverages Chainlink oracles to retrieve flight data in order to confirm whether or not it’s been delayed. By removing the need for dispute periods, insurees are guaranteed that they will immediately receive a payment if their flight was delayed and insurers are able to reduce costs by removing manual claims processing.\n\nModern vehicles come with a wide range of internal sensors, internet connectivity, and even native APIs. The winner of Chainlink’s 2020 Virtual Hackathon, Link My Ride, made use of some of these data points, allowing the smart contract to specify a rental period, unlock the vehicle doors for the renter, record the length of time rented, calculate mileage driven, determine the remaining battery charge, and automate rental payments. These functionalities came together to create a complex car rental contract for a Tesla vehicle using a custom external adapter. As vehicle-based APIs grow more sophisticated, new forms of insurance will become available including parametric car insurance that triggers based on numerous impact sensors in the vehicle or insurance discounts based on metrics like mileage driven per year.\n\nThe growing “smart home” phenomenon is leading to sensors and advanced security systems that automatically inform homeowners and emergency services of unusual events. These sensors can be connected to smart contracts through Chainlink oracles in order to create new parametric home insurance products. Especially useful for vacation homes and other residences that are not used year-round, insurance products can be wired to detect broken pipes, malfunctioning solar panels, or even home intrusions as a means of a more direct skin-in-the-game alarm system protection from companies.\n\nSmart contracts with sound data are ideal for reducing the costs and occurrence of disputes, as well as speeding up the time of settlement. Numerous web APIs and external databases host sufficient data for determining if and when a death occurred, such as death certificates, obituaries, cremation records, and police reports. Chainlink can use that data to autonomously issue out payments and distribute assets amongst several parties listed in a life insurance policy, eliminating unnecessary overhead and accelerating payments to policyholders.\n\nDue to countless advancements in biotech and IoT wearables (e.g. Smartwatches), insurance companies can create smart contracts that offer health insurance discounts or trigger penalties based on a patient’s health data. Useful data points can include distance traveled (exercise), body weight, heart rate, and possibly more advanced biometrics as they are made available into the future. Chainlink oracles can also spot data anomalies that can trigger mandatory consultations in order to keep favorable policy rates.\n\nGran Fondo, an ETHDenver 2019 Hackathon entry, used Chainlink oracles to bring GPS time-stamped data from IoT wearable devices on-chain to enable the creation of on-chain athletic competitions that payout in ETH. This same exact data can also be used to create health insurance contracts that determine premium rates based on the amount of physical activity within a certain time frame as recorded by the Chainlink-connected IoT wearable device.\n\nClimate-related uncertainty is leading to increasingly unpredictable seaway conditions such as low or high water levels. This can result in hundreds of millions of dollars lost due to the temporary closing of major shipping seaway channels. Smart contracts can use Chainlink oracles to connect to an array of real-world sensors to issue parametric insurance coverage for a wide range of coverage protections, such as the thawing of frozen goods during transit, damages to shipping vessels, or late shipments due to unforeseen weather conditions.\n\nOne example of this is a hackathon project aimed to insure cargo carriers in the event of the climate change-related closure of major shipping routes. Chainlink oracles connected to water level sensors that trigger insurance payouts in the event of water dropping or rising above present levels determined to lead to waterway closures.\n\nInsurance is a difficult industry for potential entrepreneurs to enter because of the risks associated with underwriting large numbers of policies. In a catastrophic event, an insurance company may be unable to cover all obligations, leading to default. As such, many companies “reinsure” their underwritten portfolio—offloading a portion of their risk in case they cannot cover all claims.\n\nOne possible solution would be to tokenize reinsurance policies as smart contracts. This would allow individual investors to back insurance policies by buying fractions of a policy. Chainlink oracles can be used within this process to denominate the current value of an insurance policy, route insurance payments to token holders, and autonomously trigger insurance payouts.\n\nSmart contracts provide ample opportunities for enterprises to cut costs and improve efficiency in multi-party business processes thanks to reductions in counterparty risk, intermediary overhead, and external disputes. However, in order to leverage smart contracts, enterprises require additional considerations around privacy, scalability, and connectivity in order to meet certain business and legal requirements. Chainlink provides a gateway for enterprises to both sell their data and API services to blockchain environments and satisfy certain technical requirements like on-chain access to private data, off-chain computation of contract logic, on-chain privacy of transactions, and much more.\n\nJust as the Internet acts as a single gateway for connecting computers, Chainlink provides enterprises with a single middleware for connecting their APIs to every blockchain environment. Chainlink is blockchain agnostic and can be integrated onto any current and future blockchain, with many leading chains already supporting Chainlink, such as Ethereum, Polkadot, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, and more. By having Chainlink operate across all the major chains, enterprises can leverage it as a “blockchain abstraction layer” used to get their existing systems “blockchain-enabled” across any/all chains efficiently.\n\nThis reduces integration work to a minimum so enterprises don’t have to rebuild existing infrastructure, but instead can focus on their core blockchain strategy. Vendor lock-in is limited by removing the burden of enterprises to choose which blockchain is the most likely to become the industry standard. Additionally, Chainlink nodes provide key advantages such as secure private key management, secure off-chain computation, trust-minimized hardware, permission controls, and more.\n\nChainlink’s built-in flexibility ensures it’s fully compatible with existing legacy data and API infrastructure. Thus, data providers can also use Chainlink’s blockchain abstraction layer to sell their data to smart contracts on any blockchain. This can be done in two ways: selling data to the Chainlink Network or the data provider running their own Chainlink oracle node to sell data directly to blockchains.\n\nBy selling data to the Chainlink Network, data providers don’t need to change anything about their current business model, meaning back-end modifications aren’t necessary and they can accept payments in fiat currency. Alternatively, data providers who see the value in the smart contract economy can run a Chainlink Node to provide signed data (using digital signatures) directly to smart contracts, allowing them to earn more revenue and build a reputation as a reliable data provider.\n\nOperating a Chainlink node enables data providers to begin selling their API connections to smart contracts applications. To simplify the experience of launching a Chainlink oracle node, infrastructure providers can offer Node-as-Service (NaaS) solutions in order to quickly spin up new Chainlink nodes and connect a data provider’s existing APIs to blockchain networks in a backward-compatible manner.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is an example of a leading cloud provider that has collaborated with Chainlink Labs to launch the AWS Chainlink Quickstart—a one-click workflow for data providers and DevOps teams to easily launch a Chainlink oracle node on AWS Cloud and sell real-world data to smart contracts across multiple blockchain networks. The future-proof framework enables data providers to seamlessly launch a Chainlink node on AWS, allowing them to cryptographically sign their data and broadcast it onto blockchains where it can be sold to smart contract applications.\n\nAs smart contracts evolve, there becomes an increasing demand for more advanced decentralized applications that require expensive or complex computations which are not feasible on-chain. One solution is using oracles to attest to off-chain computations processed within more scalable cloud computing environments. Leveraging Chainlink’s bidirectional communication capabilities, hybrid cloud/blockchain applications can be created that route computational instructions and/or data off-chain for processing, as well as bridge the results back on-chain for smart contract use.\n\nOne example is NOAA weather hosted on Google Cloud which is being brought onto the Etheruem blockchain using Chainlink oracles. Through this integration, smart contracts can access high-quality weather data (temperature, precipitation, hail, etc) to power parametric crop insurance agreements such as those offered by Arbol.\n\nFor many enterprises and institutions, data privacy is not an optional bonus but instead a strict requirement necessary to meet regulatory mandates such as GDPR. Chainlink is developing a cutting-edge solution to this challenge through the recent acquisition of DECO—a privacy-preserving oracle technology created by an Ari Juels-led team at Cornell University.\n\nDECO allows all data transmitted over HTTPS/TLS, which is most of the world’s data, to be confidentially attested to by oracles without the data ever being revealed on-chain (it never leaves the off-chain database) and without any modifications to the servers hosting the off-chain data. For example, Alice is able to use DECO to prove her bank account balance is above a certain threshold without revealing her exact account balance or her identity on-chain or to the oracle itself. This opens up nearly all of the world’s data to be leveraged on-chain while still retaining confidentiality and data licensing agreements.\n\nIn addition to privacy of data inputs, many enterprises want privacy of contract logic and outputs. Chainlink has developed a way of using oracles to provide on-chain transaction privacy for DeFi smart contracts via a solution called Mixicles. Mixicles separate the on-chain data inputs from on-chain payment outputs, using an oracle as the bridge between the two components and a transaction mixer. Instead of delivering the raw data input on-chain, Chainlink oracles post an integer representation that only has meaning to the contract participants (e.g. a 1 or 2 as seen in the example below). A mixer can then take that integer input to execute a payout to a party that is concealed, yet still produces an on-chain audit report for users as a means of meeting regulatory requirements. The Mixicles protocol is able to achieve multiple layers of privacy, such as concealing the terms of the contract, the data source used, the true value of funds within the contract, and who received the payment (in terms of correlation to the input).\n\nChainlink practices a defense-in-depth approach to security, where users leverage multiple layers of security to get a variety of guarantees. Another solution being developed by Chainlink is Town Crier, an oracle protocol that uses additional hardware in the form of a trusted execution environment (TEE) to achieve private, generalized off-chain computation.\n\nTown Crier uses TEE-based oracles (specifically Intel SGX) to enable Chainlink oracle nodes to perform advanced computations on data within a black box environment where data cannot be leaked, even to the node operator. Town Crier provides both data confidentiality and computation integrity, opening up new oracle use cases like handling private keys for cryptocurrency payments or user login credentials for identity verifications.\n\nAs smart contracts continue to accelerate in adoption, there is an increasing demand for practical scaling solutions that can boost the throughput and lower the latency of decentralized applications, while retaining base-layer security of user funds. Commonly these layer-2 scalability solutions require the existence of one or more off-chain validator nodes that are responsible for batching transactions and delivering a succinct response onto the base-layer chain as needed.\n\nChainlink oracle nodes are compute-enabled and can serve as validators for layer-2 solutions, such as for Offchain Labs’ Arbitrum Rollups. Chainlink nodes can perform Arbitrum computation of Solidity functions, generate fraud proofs, and stake LINK collateral to back their services without any modifications. The end result is using oracles not just for data inputs, but for performing scalable off-chain Solidity computation too.\n\nBlockchains require a decentralized network of infrastructure providers such as validators, sequencers, transcoders, and oracles. Traditional infrastructure providers, such as telecommunications firms or internet service providers, can support the Chainlink Network and earn additional revenue by directly operating a Chainlink oracle node. By leveraging their existing in-house infrastructure, such providers can provide highly reliable oracle services and monetize the growth of the hybrid smart contract ecosystem.\n\nDeutsche Telekom MMS, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom (Europe’s largest telecommunications provider) operates a Chainlink oracle node and provides financial market data to numerous leading DeFi applications. As the demand for universally connected smart contracts continues to grow, the revenue opportunities can increase, leading to additional infrastructure providers launching Chainlink nodes.\n\n“By operating a Chainlink node, Deutsche Telekom MMS will provide reliable real-world data to Chainlink network users and decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum, further supporting the vision of public blockchains as a foundation for numerous use cases such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi).” –Deutsche Telekom MMSGiven the novelty, volatility, and regulatory uncertainties around cryptocurrencies/tokens, some enterprises are currently hesitant to personally hold and handle cryptocurrencies. With most blockchain infrastructure requiring cryptocurrency to operate, enterprise adoption still remains limited or even completely blocked off. Instead of waiting on the often slow legal system to resolve the issue or for enterprises to warm up to the idea, Chainlink oracles can be used as a workaround to the problem using common invoicing techniques widely used today to allow them to pay third service providers in fiat, which then handle cryptocurrency payments in the background.\n\nHackathon project LINK Gas Station takes the concept of Meta-Transactions—where blockchain transaction fees are abstracted away and paid by a relayer—and applies it to Chainlink. It uses third-party relayers to manage ownership of the utility tokens LINK and ETH, both of which are needed to pay for Ethereum computation and obtain Chainlink oracle data services. By doing so, the liability and complexity of cryptocurrency ownership shifts away from the enterprise and onto the chosen relayer, resulting in a process where an enterprise can simply pay an invoice in fiat and gain access to the entire decentralized ecosystem. Importantly, enterprises still have full control over the cryptographic private key required to sign-off on transactions.\n\nBaseline Protocol is a framework for syncing enterprise systems of record using the Ethereum mainnet as a common frame of reference. Baseline uses zero-knowledge proofs to ensure disparate enterprise databases are kept in a state of consistency (same set of records) with their counterparties without revealing any confidential data on-chain.\n\nChainlink oracles are a key piece of infrastructure for ensuring Baseline events are using the same external data inputs. For example, dynamic purchase orders can leverage Chainlink oracles to fetch aggregated weather data (from multiple sources) regarding the temperature of the goods being shipped. The price per item in the purchase order can be autonomously updated depending on the temperature, such as bananas with dynamic pricing based on weather conditions. Chainlink’s ability to create consistency around external data inputs creates consistency among business partners, reducing disagreements and reconciliation.\n\nAs outlined in the whitepaper, Chainlink will use service level agreements (SLAs) and staking to create additional security and crypto-economic guarantees for oracle services. The SLA, which exists on-chain and is signed by both parties, defines the terms of the oracle service and the penalties/rewards issued based on the oracle’s performance. The results of the SLAs can be fed into reputation systems where future users can assess the reliability of a node. Enterprises running their own Chainlink Node can use staking-backed SLAs to bootstrap the reliability and security of their data and off-chain services, forcing them to have real economic stakes and reputation on the line for failing to meet their stated requirements. This allows enterprises and data providers to provide deterministic guarantees to automated processes like smart contracts without rebuilding their entire backend systems.\n\nA supply chain starts from the sourcing of materials and ends with delivering goods to the end customer. Along the route there are payments transferred, changes in ownership, customs clearances, regulatory oversights, and documents shared between parties. Smart contracts offer a way to automate these processes as a means of reducing friction and counterparty risks in global trade. Chainlink oracles can connect supply chain smart contracts to web APIs, cloud networks, and various real-world sensors, such as GPS, temperature, velocity, acceleration, humidity, luminosity, and more. This data can be used to trigger payments and transfers of data between parties in a manner that can’t be manipulated by any single party in the supply chain. Such a framework generates a golden source of truth for all involved parties with substantially less overhead.\n\nSupply chains are increasingly making use of RFID (radio frequency identification) technology to track goods. RFID systems connect inventory items with tags that can be detected at distance via a radio frequency. This allows for simplified and highly efficient tracking of store merchandise, shipping pallets, and many other common inventory methods. With Chainlink oracles, RFID data from the real world can be used to trigger a wide range of on-chain contracts, including the initiation of payment upon receipt of inventory at a warehouse, or autonomous insurance payouts for delayed shipments.\n\nThe Open Library Project, a project created during the Chainlink Virtual Hackathon 2020, used Chainlink oracles to build an RFID blockchain integration that enables users to check RFID-tagged books in and out and record this activity on-chain, creating a decentralized and borderless book rental platform.\n\nIoT sensors can be used to ensure that products in transit are properly maintained throughout the supply chain journey. Examples include keeping food at certain temperatures and sealing containers against tampering. Chainlink can be used to create blockchain IoT integrations by connecting IoT sensors to smart contracts that trigger onchain events, such as payouts and issuing fines depending on whether or not the IoT data confirms quality control standards were adhered to as defined in the predefined purchase order.\n\nChainlink and Vodafone’s Digital Asset Broker (DAB) have successfully demonstrated the seamless exchange of trade documents across diverse platforms and blockchains using CCIP. This collaboration has the potential to enable applications in a supply chain to securely exchange data and tokens across public and private blockchains, and access data from IoT devices via the DAB platform.\n\n“Vodafone DAB and Chainlink are showing how their platforms can be combined to cut through this sea of incompatibility by bridging traditional markets with advanced decentralised platforms. This ensures seamless and secure exchanges of data and services across the global trade ecosystem, estimated to be worth over $30 trillion last year.”—Jorge Bento, CEO of Vodafone DABAnother example of this is PingNET, a decentralized transmission network for IoT devices that uses Chainlink to help enable automated payments between stakeholders based on data from IoT-enabled pallets on PingNET. PingNet also aims to bring other IoT event data onchain, like Humidity, Altitude, UV index, Radiation, and more.\n\nWhen cargo is shipped across borders to countries with varying regulations, most often it requires clearance from the receiving nation’s customs agency to prevent the shipment of illegal or dangerous goods. Many trade finance contracts will require access to this data to determine the status of a shipment in real-time. As smart contracts begin to automate such agreements, they will still require information regarding customs clearance. Chainlink oracles can directly provide this data in a privacy-preserving manner, allowing for end-to-end automation of a cross-border trade finance contract.\n\nInternational trade paperwork largely consists of three main documents: a Bill of Lading, issued by a carrier to acknowledge receipt of cargo for shipment; an Invoice, issued by a seller to a buyer regarding the details of a sales transaction; and a Policy of Insurance—a contract between the insurer and the policyholder stating the claims the insurer is legally required to pay. Each of these documents can benefit from oracles; it would be possible to use oracles to generate a Bill of Lading directly from data, provide foreign exchange rates to Payment Invoices, and provide IoT quality control data to an on-chain Policy of Insurance contract to trigger settlement.\n\nUtilities like water, energy, and the Internet are foundational pillars of modern society. The efficient functioning and management of these utilities is vital to social and physical health, yet they often rely on poorly incentivized business dynamics and outdated infrastructure. Smart contracts bring modernization to utilities infrastructure by moving them towards fairer, automated, real-time systems that use decentralized networks, data, and crypto-economic incentives to enforce such conditions. This ensures that utility providers are held to a higher standard and users have better access to objective data showcasing the quality and status of key utility services.\n\nMany utilities like the Internet, cable TV, and cloud hosting charge customers based on set pricing structures. However, when their services go down, sometimes causing large financial losses due to opportunity costs (e.g. exchanges experiencing downtime due to a cloud outage), no one is held accountable. IoT sensors can monitor the uptime of utilities and Chainlink can feed their performance data into a smart contract to calculate monthly payments or issue reimbursements based on downtime.\n\nETHNewYork 2019 hackathon entry Blocksolid explored a use case where NGOs could hold Internet Service Providers (ISPs) accountable for faulty internet services in developing regions. They did so by tracking Internet Service Provider (ISP) uptime and using Chainlink oracles to relay this data on-chain. If downtime is detected, the on-chain smart contract holding donated funds is updated to prevent withdrawals from the ISP.\n\nEnergy providers are responsible for ensuring all the world’s infrastructure receives the energy required to power the global economy. To increase the efficiency of energy delivery, Chainlink oracles can be used to feed consumption rates into a smart contract to trigger over-consumption penalties, levy CO2 taxes, and provide current energy prices to fairly generate electricity bills and allow payments in different currencies. Smart contracts can take readings from smart meters to monetize someone’s output, track consumption, and facilitate payouts between the two.\n\nDipole, a blockchain-based distributed energy trading market, plans to use Chainlink Price Feeds to enable the on-chain trading and valuation of energy assets. Users can then purchase energy resources using fiat or cryptocurrency with exchange rates determined by Chainlink-powered decentralized price feeds.\n\nWhile often taken for granted, the infrastructure that ensures your tap at home can provide you with water is heavily monitored for quality control and reliability. IoT sensors can monitor water tables, track corporate consumption, and identify illegal siphoning of public bodies. Chainlink can feed data from this IoT data to smart contracts in order to issue regulatory fines, generate consumption invoices, trigger autopayments, update supply tracking databases, or even trigger emergency funding to cities at risk of floods.\n\nThe emissions and waste disposal industries can be transformed by IoT-enabled smart contracts that can accurately measure output and efficiency. Through Chainlink oracles, this data can be used to automatically trigger payments to the proper regulating body for overconsumption, monetize the garbage used in recycling or waste-to-fuel technologies, or generate incentivized payment structures that lower garbage bills when someone consumes less or uses more biodegradable items.\n\nWhile smart contract-enabled blockchain networks are inherently pseudonymous, there is strong demand for users to be able to prove their real-life identity as means of ensuring Sybil-resistance and/or granting clearance. Through Chainlink oracles, traditional data infrastructure containing user identities (such as governmental databases, social media, etc.) can be connected to smart contract applications, either by tying a user’s identity to their on-chain address or attesting to data in an off-chain server. This ensures institutions are able to maintain full regulatory compliance and provide an additional layer of security via dealing with known identities.\n\nE-signatures have become an increasingly popular way to obtain signatures on documents. They have modernized the signature process and helped companies avoid the costly overhead of obtaining a hand-written physical signature. With signatures being the most common way to authorize contracts, it’s a necessity that Chainlink oracles give smart contracts access to leading e-signature companies like DocuSign.\n\nChainlink can benefit the e-signature industry in two ways: attesting to the e-signature and relaying it on-chain, or providing existing e-signature solutions with access to external data as a means of making their contract solutions more dynamic. FirmaChain, a blockchain-based digital signature and contracting solution, is using Chainlink oracles to allow its digital contracts to execute according to real-world data and events, like checking the authenticity of a driver’s license before approving a car rental. Another example is EthSign, an automated contract settlement framework where users can define off-chain data sources through Chainlink oracles as well as their respective trigger conditions.\n\nAnother verifiable way to authorize a smart contract is through biometric data, such as a fingerprint or a retinal eye scan. Since biometrics are uniquely identifiable to a specific person, they can be an effective way to verify someone’s identity as long as there is a reliable database or source to cross-reference it against. Chainlink oracles can both deliver the biometric data to the smart contract and connect it to different off-chain databases to verify authenticity.\n\nUsing trusted hardware and/or advanced cryptography, Chainlink oracles securely handle the private account information of external systems and applications. This enables smart contracts to directly verify credentials, such as whether someone has the proper amount of funds or possesses a specific security key. Once Chainlink oracles relay the confirmation on-chain, the smart contract can trigger execution and settlement of funds. Bringing credentials on-chain can also be especially effective for verifying inputs before exchanging valuable assets.\n\nInstitutions leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology often require additional infrastructure to ensure full regulatory compliance in regards to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws. This requires the use of an external oracle to provide the data regarding the identity and full history of funds being transferred.\n\nCoinfirm is one example of a blockchain analytics firm that is using Chainlink oracles to bring data from its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) solution on-chain. This provides a plug-and-play solution for users wanting to add compliance to any on-chain application through real-time verification by an oracle network. Additionally, CipherTrace launched DeFi compliance oracle service on Chainlink to enable DEXs and other DeFi applications to abide by Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions requirements by providing source-signed compliance data on-chain.\n\nBlockchains still have a steep learning curve for many people, particularly around dealing with long hexadecimal addresses. In order to improve user experience, oracles are being used to help transform hexadecimal addresses into human-readable names like “chad.crypto”.\n\nOne example is Unstoppable Domains, an on-chain domain name repository using Chainlink oracles to tie a user’s Twitter social media account to their human-readable on-chain address in a verifiable and transparent manner. This allows anyone to verify that a blockchain domain is tied to a user’s social media account before sending them funds.\n\nTo ensure the integrity and proper functioning of smart contract applications, developers may want to verify whether or not a protocol has undergone one or multiple security audits before sending it funds. Using an oracle, users can get on-demand verification of audit results directly on-chain, opening up use cases like automatic checks before certain transactions, such as high-value ones, or when acting as a trusted custodian for other users funds.\n\nCybersecurity firm Hacken will use Chainlink oracles to bring their security data on-chain regarding smart contract audits, penetration tests on centralized exchanges, bug bounties, and more. This data can then be utilized by smart contracts to prevent interactions with dangerous and/or unaudited smart contracts.\n\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) is another method a user can leverage to secure their online accounts, requiring an additional layer of verification beyond a username and password. This increase of security prevents unauthorized access to confidential information, as well as preventing the transferring of funds without multiple verifications. With Chainlink oracles, smart contracts are able to be enhanced with 2FA functionalities, directly protecting a user’s cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nDigital Bridge is an example of a project using Chainlink oracles to bring 2FA security to smart contracts on the Matic Network. By connecting to a high-availability 2FA API authentication service, Chainlink enables users to create a defense-in-depth strategy for their on-chain funds, preventing unauthorized transfers even in the event that their private key is stolen.\n\nAll types of intellectual property, from royalties like copyrights and trademarks to license fees for patents, can be turned into smart contracts. Chainlink can be used to check IP databases for ownership verification, verify off-chain credentials before IP access, and facilitate payments from the user to the IP owner. Smart contracts could even tokenize partial ownership of IP and divvy out payments according to a person’s share percentage. Large enterprises such as Microsoft and EY have shown this to be a practical solution that significantly reduces operational inefficiencies in the rights and royalties management process.\n\nOpen-source technology is growing in popularity, and can benefit from more expansive bounty programs to incentivize contributions. However, verification of a contributor’s work and payments to them are often manual processes, raising costs and delaying payout timelines. Chainlink oracles can be used to track contributions on public code repositories such as GitHub and unlock a payment escrow once predefined test cases for a bounty have passed without errors.\n\nWhile society may not agree on various issues, an initiative most people can get behind is creating more transparency, accountability, and efficiency in government institutions. Blockchains provide society with new infrastructure for tracking and executing government processes, smart contracts offer tamperproof guardrails on how governments are allowed to take action, and oracles allow for the use of objective data to trigger the execution of those actions as opposed to always leaving it up to centralized interpretation. Oracles are one of the most important ingredients to realizing the value of smart contracts within government processes, as they both provide a bridge to connect legacy infrastructure to blockchains and serve as the final triggers for executing the contract.\n\nEnterprise use of smart contracts will require new forms of automated regulatory compliance. While some restrictions can be hardcoded into the smart contract’s programmatic code, governments can also make use of oracles as a way of extracting metadata from the smart contract or requiring external approval from a government-run oracle before broadcasting a transaction.\n\nAn example of a Compliance Oracle was outlined in the Project Whitney Case Study initiated by the Depository and Trust Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the post-trade financial services company that settles the vast majority of securities transactions in the United States. As stated in the case study, a compliance oracle is a “Dynamic rules engine that enables issuers and investors to maintain compliance throughout a securities lifecycle by approving/rejecting transactions. When a transaction is approved, the stock record is updated, and the movement of tokens on-chain occurs.”Given the recent polarization around election results, there is increasing demand for secure, tamper-proof voting solutions that establish integrity in the election process. While it may take time to overhaul government voting systems, one can envision a simplified scenario where a vote can be cast on-chain using a private key, an oracle can verify the ID of the person from multiple approved sources in a privacy-preserving manner via DECO, and, if they match, then a confirmation is published on-chain where it is stored as an immutable record that can be cryptographically verified by anyone. This leads to the creation of a more sustainable democracy through tamper-proof voting, aligning with the United Nations’ sustainable development goals.\n\nSmart contracts can be used to bring more efficiency and integrity to the issuance of government certificates, permits, and deeds. Oracles can be used to generate certificates more autonomously, such as through using DECO to verify a person’s credentials before sending them a tokenized document such as a permit. Using a system like DECO allows the smart contract to query a set of authoritative sources in a privacy-preserving manner. Such an automated process could save billions of dollars in government spending.\n\nHybrid smart contracts that combine on-chain code and real-world data from IoT sensors and satellite data can be leveraged to create fully traceable, transparent, and automated incentivization systems that directly reward individuals, companies, and governments for taking part in sustainable practices and fighting against both climate change and mitigating its harmful effects. This can include the creation of tokenized carbon offsets, regenerative agriculture, and even the monitoring of consumption to reward those who stay within their means.\n\nThe Green World Campaign is an example of one project that aims to use hybrid smart contracts to incentivize regenerative agriculture in a reforestation program created in collaboration with IC3 and funded by a Chainlink Community Grant. This program uses satellite remote sensing data that is fed on-chain by Chainlink oracles to reward stewards of regenerative agriculture who help reforest degraded land. By incentivizing carbon drawdown, their plan is to eventually plant billions of trees and help raise the living and health standards of those in developing regions.\n\nWhile slightly more advanced, it’s not hard to imagine a future where satellite imagery is used in combination with IoT networks and drones to gather data on external activities like a construction project. Through artificial intelligence, the data could then be analyzed and cross-referenced with past projects to determine the completion percentage of a project. Chainlink oracles could relay that data to an on-chain smart contract to issue completion-based payouts to construction companies, solving a major problem in delayed cash flows for companies performing large, time-consuming projects.\n\nDuring a fireside chat between Chainlink Labs Chief Scientist Ari Juels and Chainlink Co-founder Sergey Nazarov, Ari discussed his early work with PhD student Sishan Long on a project called AIRS: Automated Incentives for Reforestation Stewardship. AIRS aims to incentivize stewardship of the environment by consistently taking in satellite data (carbon capture capacity, the ability to sequester carbon, carbon sync capability, etc.) and monitoring its state over time using trusted execution environments. The idea is for entities like governments and NGOs to pour money into the smart contract, which then gets dispensed to the people who are responsible for maintaining and expanding this very important carbon sink, incentivizing sustainable practices.\n\nOn-chain applications do not have access to a secure Random Number Generator (RNG) due to the deterministic nature of blockchain networks. Using the on-chain blockhash can result in manipulation from blockchain miners/validators who discard blocks with unfavorable hashes and can “re-roll the dice”, ultimately changing the RNG value. Naive off-chain solutions are opaque and provide no proof that the RNG value produced is legitimate and has not been manipulated by either the data source or oracle node. Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) overcomes these issues by providing smart contracts with a secure source of randomness backed by a cryptographic proof that cannot be manipulated by oracle nodes, users, or development teams.\n\nChainlink VRF works by combining block data that is still unknown when the request is made with the oracle node’s pre-committed private key to generate both a random number and a cryptographic proof. Consuming smart contracts will only accept the random number input if it has a valid cryptographic proof. This provides users with automated and publicly verifiable assurances directly on-chain that each smart contract application using Chainlink VRF for randomness is provably fair. Verifiable randomness can be used across a wide of use cases including dynamic NFTs, on-chain gaming applications, off-chain systems, and beyond.\n\nSmart contracts are pieces of code that run deterministically on the blockchain. However, they are “asleep” by default and must be “awoken” by some external entity to perform on-chain functions and change contract states. Chainlink Automation provides smart contract developers, decentralized applications (dApps), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) a solution to this problem through a highly reliable, decentralized, and cost-efficient decentralized network of nodes that can automate any smart contract function and perform regular contract maintenance.\n\nChainlink Automation can be used for a wide range of smart contract functions including executing limit orders on a DEX, minting new tokens when a reserve increases in value, harvesting yield from a vault, rebasing elastic supply tokens, triggering automated trading strategies, liquidating undercollateralized loans, releasing vesting tokens, topping up token balances falling below a threshold, and much more.\n\nIt’s unlikely that one blockchain will come to dominate the entire smart contract market, especially when considering throughput limitations, jurisdictional differences, and specialization of chains. Such a multi-blockchain universe means that blockchains must cross-communicate with one another. However, due to their inherent security properties, blockchains cannot natively access data on other blockchain networks, a very similar issue to the oracle problem. Chainlink oracles can be used to bridge this gap by reading data on one blockchain and writing the results on another as a means of triggering some type of cross-chain interactions and/or simply an on-chain transaction on the chain requesting the information.\n\nThe Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is an open-source standard that will provide a secure, decentralized, and expandable cross-chain messaging solution that will enable smart contracts on any blockchain network to send messages, transfer tokens, and initiate actions across any other blockchain network. In addition to generalized message passing between chains, CCIP enables the creation of cross-chain bridges such as the Programmable Token Bridge reference implementation, allowing for the transfers of tokens along with commands to any other blockchain network.\n\nWhile Chainlink oracles are commonly recognized for their ability to fetch and deliver data from the real world on-chain in a reliable and secure manner, they can also perform various off-chain computations including the ordering of transactions. Chainlink’s development of Fair Sequencing Services (FSS) will allow decentralized applications to mitigate Miner Extractable Value (MEV) by ensuring transaction ordering cannot be manipulated by miners as a means of siphoning value from users. Additionally, by preventing front-running attacks, gas costs can be drastically reduced and DEXs can become more trustworthy (e.g. trades are honored according to fairer rules like their arrival in the mempool).\n\nIn order to prevent spam attacks, transactions on smart contract-enabled blockchains require the gas fees in the native token to pay for the cost miners expend to validate a transaction. However, the market that determines gas prices happens off-chain and thus smart contracts require an oracle to fetch the current cost per unit of gas.\n\nAn example of this in action is ETHA Lend, an on-chain yield optimizer that uses the Chainlink gas price oracle to help build and execute algorithmically optimized yield strategies for LPs. Smart contracts can also use this gas price oracle to create gas price financial products and other financial products designed for hedging against blockchain network congestion and high transaction costs.\n\nWith the advent of blockchain-based public sales, many projects are looking for ways to fairly choose the order of sale participants beyond the common “first come, first serve”’ model, which can be easily manipulated. Initially popularized by centralized exchanges, there is an increasing shift towards a randomized-based selection of sale participants within smart contracts.\n\nOne example is Centaur, a DeFi platform that uses Chainlink VRF to determine the participants in an on-chain public sale. Based on a list of addresses accumulated before the sale, Chainlink VRF determines in a verifiable and fair manner which addresses from that list are allowed to participate in the on-chain public sale.\n\nAnother example is Get Protocol, a blockchain-based event ticketing solution that uses Chainlink VRF to randomly determine a digital waiting line for in-demand concerts and events. This provides users with an equal opportunity to obtain tickets, in a manner they can independently verify on-chain as unbiased.\n\nSome protocols use unpredictability as a form of security, for example by randomly choosing validators for block production. An insecure source of randomness would allow malicious actors to overly insert themselves into the process and manipulate the production of blocks, possibly even bringing the network to a halt. Chainlink VRF can be used as a tamper-proof source of randomness to fairly choose validators each time a block of transactions needs to be produced, protecting blockchain networks from a large category of key attack vectors.\n\nAs a generalized framework for building decentralized oracle networks, Chainlink provides developers the tools they need to connect their smart contract applications to any real-world data or events required for their use case. While the use cases listed above are not an exhaustive list, as there is an infinite number of smart contract use cases made possible by Chainlink, we believe they provide a starting point for developers who are interested in building new innovative decentralized applications.\n\nIf you’re a developer and want to quickly get your smart contract application connected to Chainlink oracles, visit the developer documentation and join the technical discussion in Discord.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A blockchain wallet is a digital wallet that enables users to manage the cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether.\n\nBroadly speaking, a blockchain wallet is a digital wallet that allows users to store, manage, and trade their cryptocurrencies. Blockchain Wallet is also the name of a specific wallet service provided by the company Blockchain. This is an E-wallet that allows individuals to store and transfer cryptocurrencies. Blockchain Wallet users can manage their balances of Bitcoin, Ether, and other crypto assets. Blockchain Wallet charges dynamic fees, meaning that the transaction fees can be different based on factors such as transaction size. Blockchain Wallet has a number of security features to prevent theft, including by company insiders.\n\n",
    "content": "A blockchain wallet is a digital wallet that allows users to store and manage their Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain Wallet can also refer to the wallet service provided by Blockchain, a software company founded by Peter Smith and Nicolas Cary. A blockchain wallet allows transfers in cryptocurrencies and the ability to convert them back into a user\u0027s local currency.\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain Wallet\n\nE-wallets allow individuals to store cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. In the case of Blockchain Wallet, users can manage their balances of various cryptocurrencies such as the well-known Bitcoin and Ether as well as stellar, Tether, and Paxos Standard.\n\nCreating an e-wallet with Blockchain Wallet is free, and the account setup process is done online. Individuals must provide an email address and password that will be used to manage the account, and the system will send an automated email requesting that the account be verified.\n\nOnce the wallet is created, the user is provided with a Wallet ID, which is a unique identifier similar to a bank account number. Wallet holders can access their e-wallet by logging into the Blockchain website, or by downloading and accessing a mobile application.\n\nThe Blockchain Wallet interface shows the current wallet balance for crypto-assets and the user’s most recent transactions. Users can also access the price charts and see the value of the funds in the chosen local currency of the user. There is also an educational Did You Know section sharing crypto facts and news.\n\nHow a Blockchain Wallet Works\n\nUsers can send a request to another party for a specific amount of bitcoin or other crypto-assets, and the system generates a unique address that can be sent to a third party or converted into a Quick Response code or QR code for short. A QR code is similar to a barcode, which stores financial information and can be read by a digital device.\n\nA unique address is generated each time the user makes a request. Users can also send crypto-assets when someone provides them with a unique address. The send-and-receive process is similar to sending or receiving funds through PayPal but uses cryptocurrency instead. PayPal is an online payment provider that acts as a go-between for customers and their banks and credit cards by facilitating online transfers through financial institutions.\n\nUsers can also exchange Bitcoin for other crypto-assets and visa-versa, known as swapping. This practice is an easy way to switch out crypto without leaving the security of the Blockchain Wallet. Users are shown a quote indicating how much they will receive based on the current exchange rate, with the rate changing depending on how long the user takes to complete the transaction. Swaps should take a couple of hours while the transactions are added to each currency’s blockchain. However, if it takes longer than six hours, users should contact customer support.\n\nBlockchain Wallet only allows six crypto-assets for swapping: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar Lumens, Tether, USD Digital, Wrapped-DGLD.\n\nUsers can also buy or sell crypto through the Buy Crypto interface available to Blockchain Wallet. Buy and sell services are not available in all locations. To make a purchase, a user can either transfer funds from a bank, use a credit or debit card, or use the available cash balance. There is a daily limit of $25,000 and a weekly limit of $100,000 as well as a minimum buy order of $5 and a maximum buy order of $25,000.\n\nBlockchain Wallet Fees\n\nHowever, it\u0027s important to note that the Blockchain Wallet uses a process they call dynamic fees, meaning that the fee charged per transaction can be different based on various factors. Both the transaction size and the conditions of the network at the time of the transaction can greatly impact the size of the fee. Only so many transactions can be processed within a block by the high-powered computers called miners. The miners typically process the transactions that have the highest fees first since it\u0027s financially advantageous to them.\n\nBlockchain Wallet offers a priority fee, which could possibly get the transaction processed within an hour. There\u0027s also a regular fee, which is cheaper but the transaction would likely take more than an hour. Fees can also be customized by the customer. However, if the customer sets the fee too low, the transfer or transaction could be delayed or rejected.\n\nBlockchain Wallet Security\n\nWallet security is an important consideration for users, as a compromised account may result in users losing control of their assets. Blockchain Wallet has several levels of security to protect user funds from any possible attacker, including the company itself.\n\nLike other digital services, Blockchain Wallet accounts require passwords for the users\u0027 protection. However, the Blockchain company does not store user passwords, and cannot reset the password if lost. This measure prevents company insiders from being able to steal cryptocurrencies. If a user forgets or loses their password, the account can only be recovered with a mnemonic seed.\n\nA mnemonic seed is a random string of English words that function similarly to a password. If a user loses access to their phone or device, the seed can be used to restore the wallet, including any cryptocurrencies. Like passwords, the Blockchain company does not store users\u0027 mnemonic seeds. These seeds follow an industry standard, meaning the wallets can be recovered even if the company goes out of business.\n\nIn addition to the protections outlined above, there are also several optional security measures that are not required but can help secure user wallets against outside attacks. To reduce the danger of phishing, the Blockchain Wallet allows users to use two-factor authentication or IP whitelists to prevent log-ins from unfamiliar devices. It is also possible to block access through the Tor network, thereby preventing prospective hackers from disguising their IP addresses.\n\n",

    "summary": "The popularity of Bitcoin ETFs had created concerns regarding the possibilities for approval of Ethereum ETFs. The good news for anyone interested in ETFs\n\n",
    "content": "The popularity of Bitcoin ETFs had created concerns regarding the possibilities for approval of Ethereum ETFs. The good news for anyone interested in ETFs is that the US Securities and Exchange Commission has issued approval of eight Ethereum ETFs. Your curiosity to learn Ethereum ETF fundamentals might stem from the identity of Ethereum as a frontrunner in the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum has consistently achieved new milestones with its smart contract programming abilities that offer new prospects for the dApp ecosystem.\n\nEthereum ETFs can open the doors for institutional investors to diversify their portfolios with an innovative asset. The approval of ETH ETFs could also boost the adoption of Ethereum as well as its pricing. Let us learn more about Ethereum ETFs and how they work.\n\nEmbrace the technological leap and global adoption that awaits in the upcoming bull run of 2024-2025 with Crypto Bull Run Ready Career Path\n\nYou are likely to find multiple definitions of Ethereum ETFs on different platforms. The most accurate answer to “What is Ethereum ETF?” describes them as a collection of securities that represent the value of Ethereum. With Ethereum ETFs, investors don’t have to buy Ethereum directly on cryptocurrency exchanges. After the SEC approval for Ethereum ETFs, you can invest in ETFs on popular stock exchanges.\n\nThe availability of Ethereum ETFs is a promising news for traditional investors. Investors can make the most of the price movements of Ether on regulated platforms. You don’t have to worry about the complexities of crypto exchanges or digital wallets to access Ethereum ETFs. Ethereum exchange traded fund are distinct types of investment funds that follow the market value of Ether and allow investors to capitalize on the benefits of crypto markets.\n\nYou can find out how to buy Ethereum ETF in almost every guide on Ethereum ETFs. Ethereum ETFs are listed on traditional stock exchanges and do not require buyers to have a wallet or interactions with crypto exchanges. Investors without intricate knowledge of the technical aspects of cryptocurrencies can make the most of market movements of Ethereum with ETFs. Exchange traded funds remove the burden of dealing with the complex elements of digital asset management.\n\nEnroll now in the Ethers.js Blockchain Developer Course to develop an in-depth understanding of smart contracts and their uses for creating secure and efficient Ethereum transactions.\n\nEthereum ETFs offer exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without purchasing and holding Ether directly in your wallets or crypto exchanges. Almost every Ethereum ETF guide shows that the exchange traded fund invests in Ethereum or Ethereum-related assets on your behalf. The two most crucial elements in the working of Ethereum ETFs include the structure and purchase method and the exposure to Ethereum price movements.\n\nThe structure and purchase method focuses on setting up the fund. Fund managers create a fund to track price movements of Ethereum to set up Ethereum ETFs. You can easily purchase or sell shares of the fund through conventional stock exchanges. This method is simpler and less complicated than using crypto exchanges.\n\nAfter discovering how to buy Ethereum ETF, you must think of the next steps to capitalize on ETFs. Investors don’t have to worry about managing their Ether ETFs as they are linked directly to Ether prices. Fluctuations in the value of Ethereum leads to changes in the value of Ethereum ETFs with the same proportion. Ethereum ETFs can help investors in speculation on pricing of Ether without ownership of the cryptocurrency.\n\nLearn about the basic concepts of Ethereum, such as transactions, addresses, consensus, blocks, and important tools with the Ethereum Technology Course.\n\nEthereum ETFs are available in two different variants. You must learn Ethereum ETF fundamentals with attention to the types of Ethereum ETFs to pick the ideal variant according to your needs. The two variants of Ethereum ETFs, spot ETFs and futures ETFs, offer distinct traits and work in different ways.\n\nSpot ETFs are funds that serve as massive digital wallets that hold Ether directly in the fund. Ethereum spot ETFs offer direct price exposure by mirroring the real-time Ethereum price movements. The value of the Ethereum spot ETF would change according to fluctuations in the real-time pricing of Ethereum. If the price of Ether increases by 20%, the value of the ETF would also increase by the same range. The special highlight of Ethereum spot ETFs is that the fund manager would have to buy actual Ether tokens.\n\nEthereum futures ETFs have gained popularity after the Ethereum ETF approval for their unique working mechanism. Futures ETFs do not hold actual ETH tokens like the spot ETFs. Futures ETFs invest in futures contracts that specify conditions for purchasing or selling ETH tokens at a specific price in future. Ethereum futures ETFs rely prominently on speculations rather than real-time ETH prices.\n\nIt is also important to remember that you can access Ethereum futures contracts through listings on commodities exchanges. The futures contracts offer direct exposure to price movements of Ethereum without the problems of direct ownership. The performance of the futures contracts determine the value of Ethereum futures ETFs.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nThe primary difference between Ethereum spot ETFs and futures ETFs ultimately rounds up on the direct exposure to Ether pricing. After learning the answers to “What is Ethereum ETF?” you must differentiate between spot ETFs and futures ETFs. The differences between spot ETFs and futures ETFs help you identify the better alternative. Investors must compare the benefits and setbacks of both types of ETFs to make the most of Ethereum ETFs.\n\nSpot ETFs involve direct ownership of ETH tokens and offer exposure to real-time price movements of Ethereum in crypto markets. Futures ETFs rely on the expected value of Ether at a specific point of time in future. Go through some of the notable implications associated with the two types of Ethereum ETFs.\n\nSpot ETFs buy ETH tokens directly and store them in a basket fund. The value of spot ETFs is directly related to the existing market price of Ether. Spot ETFs can offer real-time exposure to price movements of Ether. You can think of Ethereum spot ETFs as huge digital wallets that store ETH on your behalf. Spot ETFs address concerns such as ‘how to buy Ethereum ETF’ with the assurance of secure storage.\n\nIt is important to remember that purchasing and selling ETH through spot ETFs can affect the market demand and supply. Direct exposure to ETH price changes makes spot ETFs more vulnerable to market volatility of Ethereum. The popular examples of Ethereum spot ETFs include Evolve Ethereum ETF and Purpose Ethereum ETF.\n\nEthereum futures ETFs invest in contracts that specify conditions for purchasing or selling ETH at a specific price in future. Futures ETFs rely primarily on speculation of the potential price of Ether in future. As compared to spot ETFs that mirror the present value of ETH, futures ETFs require more risk tolerance. The Ethereum ETF approval propelled the rise of Ethereum futures contracts with popular names such as VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF. Ethereum futures ETFs bet on the price of ETH expected tomorrow rather than its today’s price.\n\nThe foremost advantage of Ethereum futures ETFs is the freedom from complexities of digital asset custody. Futures ETFs can easily resolve the security concerns that come with holding cryptocurrencies directly in your fund. The trading of futures ETFs has limited impact on the market demand and supply of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum futures ETFs present certain complexities in the form of additional costs involved during their rollover. Futures ETFs expose investors to the volatility of Ethereum and futures markets. Investors with higher risk tolerance and in-depth understanding of the futures markets can work effectively with Ethereum futures ETFs. You must also look out for periodic contract renewals that bring additional costs.\n\nThe most important factors that you must keep in mind while choosing between spot ETFs and futures ETFs include investor preference and risk and exposure.\n\nExcited to learn the basics of cryptocurrency and the ways in which blockchain technology empowers cryptocurrencies, Enroll now in the Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Course\n\nThe eagerness of investors to learn Ethereum ETF basics has increased after the SEC approved Ethereum ETFs. Approval of Ethereum ETFs would have a formidable impact on the crypto market with sudden growth in popularity of Ethereum. Investors could capitalize on the benefit of easier accessibility through ETFs and enhance the prospects for mainstream adoption of Ether.\n\nExchange traded funds offer a regulated approach for investing in Ether. Institutional investors can trust the elements of security and privacy in Ethereum ETFs. It would lead to substantial growth in the inflow of institutional capital thereby ensuring stability and maturity of the market.\n\nThe SEC Ethereum ETF approval is likely to create a ripple effect in the crypto industry and encourage the rise of innovative crypto-related financial solutions. Ethereum ETFs may also pave the path for establishing comprehensible legal frameworks and regulatory guidelines for crypto investments.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the popular blockchain network, Ethereum, and ensure overall, comprehensive skill development with Ethereum Skill Path\n\nThe approval for Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 created hopes for the introduction of Ethereum ETFs. Ethereum exchange traded funds would mark a milestone in the evolution of the cryptocurrency landscape, especially for investors. The Ethereum ETF guide showcased the potential reasons for which institutional investors might take interest in ETFs. Ethereum ETFs take away the complexities and security concerns associated with digital asset management.\n\nThe impact of Ethereum ETFs on the broader crypto market is also visible in the availability of two different variants of ETFs. Investors can choose spot ETFs or futures ETFs according to their requirements and financial goals. Enroll now in the crypto bull run ready career path to learn more about cryptocurrency ETFs and how they can revolutionize the crypto market now.\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer: The article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide any investment advice.

    "summary": "A year ago, “Crypto+AI” sounded like a game of “VC mad libs.” Now, as real-world applications begin to emerge, the idea makes much more sense. Jeff Wilser, who is hosting the AI Summit at Consensus 2024, offers a preview of the programming and reviews the decentralized AI state-of-play.\n\n",
    "content": "Almost exactly one year ago, I wrote a piece for CoinDesk called 10 Ways Crypto and AI Can Make Each Other Better (or Maybe Worse). At the time, the idea of “Crypto + AI” was still a novel concept. Even fringe. To many, AI development felt adjacent — at best — to the world of Web3. To others, “Crypto + AI” felt like a cynical mix of two hype-y trends, like VC mad libs.\n\nFlash forward one year.\n\nDecentralized AI is arguably the hottest topic in the web3 space. Dozens of projects — maybe hundreds, it’s hard to keep track — are now racing to merge the tools of blockchain with the taming of AI. The space is booming. By the time you finish reading this article, another DePIN startup will have launched. And the architects of this movement are converging in Austin, for Consensus 2024, in CoinDesk’s inaugural “AI Summit.” (I’ll cop to some bias: I helped organize the event and I’ll be hosting on May 31.)\n\nSo why is this happening, and why does it matter?\n\nYou could argue that the stakes of decentralized AI are higher than the stakes of decentralized finance. In some ways the principles are the same. Satoshi Nakamoto was wary of centralized financial institutions that acted badly and jeopardized people’s money. As AI becomes a greater part of our lives — and that feels inevitable — it will have the power to shape how we see the world, how we interact with the world, and how we present to the world. It could shape how we think. Should this be controlled by the billionaire de jour?\n\nLet’s look at two concrete examples, one that’s straightforward and one that’s chilling. The next frontier of Gen AI is likely the rise of AI agents, which can do things like book your flight, pay your phone bill, or invest your money in stocks. (“Hey Siri, go ahead and put $1,000 in the S\u0026P.”)\n\nDo we want Big Tech to control not just our data, but also what we do with it?\n\nMore chilling: It’s likely that millions of people will someday use AI chatbots — perhaps through audio or even video — as coaches or even therapists. Early versions are here now. (On my podcast AI-Curious, for example, I interviewed a longtime coach who’s working with the German Research Center to develop AI-based personal coaching. It’s coming. It’s inevitable.) Millions of people will share their inner-most thoughts, longings, fears, sexual desires, confessions and embarrassments. Do we want this sliced and diced by Zuckerberg and co.? The decentralized and privacy-preserving tech of blockchain, potentially, could give us the fruits of AI without the poison of Big Tech.\n\nThese are the stakes of decentralized AI. These are the topics covered at the AI Summit. (Or some of the topics. Others include how blockchain can help us preserve truth in an era of deepfakes, fight censorship, make “AI compute” more inclusive, fight bias, lead to AI alignment, and on and on.)\n\nWhile an explosion of AI + Crypto projects have launched since 2022, some have been around for years and have been quietly building. One is Singularity NET, founded in 2017 by Ben Goertzel, a prominent AI researcher, with an early vision of building decentralized AI. “My initial vision for what became SingularityNET occurred to me in ’95 or ’96, when the internet became a thing,” Goertzel told me recently in Panama City, at an AI conference hosted by Singularity. “It seemed to me, the internet shouldn’t be centralized. The internet is a decentralized network. So why would you want to have a centralized search service?” The seeds of this idea included AI (which he has studied since the 80s), and Goertzel has the receipts: A 2001 book “Creating Internet Intelligence” that fuses all these concepts.\n\nGoertzel will share his thoughts on how to actually pull off this vision at the AI Summit, along with other pioneers trying to hammer out the plumbing, pipes, and protocols of decentralized AI. That brings us to DePIN (or decentralized physical infrastructure networks), where communities of token-holders are incentivized to participate in building online services.\n\nGensyn, for example, is building a decentralized network that will let the untapped computing power from individual users (like you and me) be harnessed for the training of AI data, a la Filecoin for cloud storage. “We’re kind of running out of places to build enormous data centers,” Gensyn’s co-founder Ben Fielding told me last year, before this became a trendy topic. If Gensyn pulls this off, says Fielding, “You don’t just have one big data center. Now you have every data center on the planet.” (Fielding will also be taking the stage at the AI Summit, along with the heads of DePIN projects IoTeX and Grass.)\n\nWhile many of the Web3+AI projects are infrastructure plays, there are now attempts to build decentralized GenAI models that compete directly with the OpenAIs of the world. And that gets us to another example of the crypto-meets-AI space, Erik Voorhees, a bitcoin OG who has vocally supported Morpheus (decentralized and open-sourced AI) and recently announced the launch of VeniceAI.\n\nIn a Twitter/X thread, Voorhees argued that Venice is similar to centralized chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude and even Grok, but “without all the Orwellian stuff” and that “Venice doesn’t spy on you,” “Venice doesn’t censor your conversation,” and “Venice doesn’t inject bias, safetyism, or political propaganda.” Only 10 days later he showed it in action and said, “There are no ads in Venice.ai and you get basically the same answer as MSFTCopilot.” Shots fired.\n\nVoorhees and Venice are just some of the players in this space. There are countless more. Every day there’s a new launch or new partnerships. Just in the last few days, for example, Eternal AI announced a partnership with Filecoin, as a Twitter/X post explained that “Filecoin will provide decentralized storage for AI models, while Eternal AI, with its network of AI agents, will provide decentralized inference.”\n\nSome of these many, many Web3/AI projects are in the earliest phases of ideation – little more than concept, capital, and chutzpah – but some have legs and are gaining traction. Take Rejuve AI (part of the SingularityNET ecosystem), which uses blockchain (and RJV token) to incentivize and reward people for sharing privacy-preserving health data, intended to create a massive) data-set that can be analyzed by AI, as well as hyper-personalized health trends and diagnoses. “We’re building the health and wellness economy for longevity around the RJV token, decentralizing and democratizing access to these advanced technologies,” says CEO Jasmine Smith. This is well past the whiteboard phase. Smith says 2,000 testers have contributed to the beta version; she expects it to launch in the App Store soon.\n\nOne reason these projects are all suddenly so prevalent? To be cynical for a moment, sure, there’s heat in the space and VCs like heat. (The return of a crypto bull market doesn’t hurt.) But another reason is that, in a sense, there are no other options. There aren’t many centralized AI players. The costs are staggering so only a handful can play at the table.\n\n“The power concentration [of AI] is getting worse, not better,” says Nathaniel Whittemore, aka NLW, host of the AI Daily Brief and founder of BeSuperAI, who’s hosting an AI Town Hall at Consensus. “And greater concentration leads to more of a feeling of a need for decentralized approaches.”\n\nNone of this will happen overnight. In some ways, it’s all still a longshot. We need the smartest people in the space to collaborate, argue, and swap ideas and inspiration. We need an AI Summit.\n\n",

    "content": "The thought of creating images from text prompts is something that would have seemed obsolete a few years ago. However, the AI revolution changed everything, and the rising interest in the use of AI tools has led to development of numerous platforms that can generate new images. You must have heard about the best AI image generator apps such as Midjourney or Stable Diffusion and their features.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone cannot afford the cost of using Midjourney as a beginner or the technical complexities of using Stable Diffusion. Therefore, it is important to look for user-friendly platforms that offer artificial intelligence art generation capabilities without a price. You can find different types of AI image generator apps with a free trial or a monthly fee that can fit within anyone’s budget. Let us find out some of the most popular free AI image generators you should try in 2024.\n\n\n\n2023 witnessed the rise of generative AI, and new apps made their entry into the market with some out-of-the-box features. However, even the advanced tool to generate AI images was not able to come up with creative answers to the prompts by users. On the other hand, the advancements in AI image generators have led to the introduction of innovative features that can help you create realistic and unique images. Interestingly, the free versions of AI image generators can help you learn about their different features and the best ways to use them. Here is an outline of the different free tools that can help you generate high-quality images from text.\n\nIdeogram is the most popular AI image generator that you can use for free.

    "content": "On-chain data suggests that some Ethereum whales might be jumping off the bandwagon amidst the ongoing tug-of-war between bulls and bears. This phenomenon has become increasingly evident as transaction data from whale trackers reveals a significant uptick in whale activity over the past 24 hours. The majority of these transactions are directed towards various crypto exchanges, indicating a possible shift in strategy or sentiment among these large-scale investors.\n\nNotably, on-chain transaction alerts from Whale_Alerts show that approximately $205 million worth of ETH has been transferred into crypto exchange Coinbase from unknown wallets within the past 24 hours.\n\nAs noted earlier, transaction alerts from whale transaction tracker Whale_Alerts show that 61,819 ETH were sent to the crypto exchange Coinbase in the past 24 hours from whale wallets. These transactions, collectively worth $205 million at the time of transfer, were made known through the social media platform X.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the movement into Coinbase wasn’t made through a lump sum but was made through a series of five transfers, each with an average of 10,290 ETH worth over $34 million. Interestingly, the transfers were made in such a consecutive manner that it might suggest that they were controlled by the same entity. Regardless, the movement of such a significant amount of ETH has ignited attention, as evidenced by comments on the alerts on X. Observers are speculating about the intentions behind these transfers, with most suggesting a potential liquidation.\n\n🚨 🚨 10,291 #ETH (34,116,942 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/nDVnyKT28v\n\n— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 29, 2024\n\n🚨 🚨 10,291 #ETH (34,162,130 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/Z5vofQNoso\n\n— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 29, 2024\n\n🚨 🚨 10,323 #ETH (34,492,433 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/Z5rp3IHwFe\n\n— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 29, 2024\n\n🚨 🚨 10,291 #ETH (34,097,937 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/dUggaEZ0XM\n\n— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 29, 2024\n\n🚨 🚨 🚨 20,623 #ETH (68,335,696 USD) transferred from Coinbase Institutional to unknown new wallethttps://t.co/62HNL1iGxi\n\n— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 29, 2024\n\nThe increase in whale activity comes at a time when Ethereum is experiencing considerable volatility. ETH bulls and bears are currently engaged in a fierce battle for control after the launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nCrypto whales have considerable influence over market dynamics. Their actions are closely monitored by retail traders and analysts. As a result, these substantial Ethereum transfers to Coinbase could have significant implications for the cryptocurrency market. When large amounts of ETH move to exchanges, it often signals an intention to sell, which may lead to increased selling pressure. This influx of supply could drive down the price of Ethereum in the short term.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,340 and has struggled to maintain a position above a significant resistance level of $3,357. This resistance point represents a formidable order block, which has consistently posed challenges for bullish investors in the past 30 days. The recent substantial transfers of Ethereum to Coinbase likely contributed to the difficulty in overcoming this resistance.\n\nDespite this, there is a prevailing bullish sentiment within the trading community, with many traders anticipating initial breakouts above key order blocks around $3,357 and $3,540.\n\nIn other news, the Ethereum community recently celebrated the cryptocurrency’s 9th birthday.\n\nHappy 9th birthday, Ethereum!\n\nLooking forward to seeing what the next decade brings. pic.twitter.com/bXq56mIff7\n\n— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) July 30, 2024\n\n",

Solana’s SOL, BNB Chain’s BNB and dogecoin (DOGE) were up at least 1%.\n\nCelestia’s TIA led gains among tokens with a market capitalization between $1 billion and $5 billion, jumping 15% ahead of its flagship Modular Summit conference scheduled for Thursday.\n\nThe broad-based CoinDesk 20, an index of the largest tokens, edged higher, reversing a 7% loss from earlier in the day.\n\nMeanwhile, BTC traders are back to tracking U.S. Federal Reserve speeches and policies as the market has largely priced in the impact of defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox’s repayments.\n\nBTC saw one of its steepest falls last week as prices fell more than 8% in the span of a few hours on Friday, falling to as low as $53,600 shortly after Mt. Gox started moving millions worth of the token to the Japan-based bitBank exchange. The exchange’s trading desk, however, told CoinDesk in a Monday email that they expect lesser market impact from Mt. Gox’s wallet movements ahead.\n\n“Bitcoin was already fluctuating around $54,000 by the time Mt.Gox’s trustee officially announced that they had commenced repayment,” Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at bitBank, said. “The price bounced back after the announcement and briefly recovered $58,000 during the weekend.”\n\n“The market had overly priced in the repayment before it actually started, and later reacted to the (U.S.) jobs report on Friday, which was announced after the beginning of Mt.Gox’s repayment,\" Hasegawa added. \"This suggests that the market’s concern for Mt.Gox’s repayment is starting to wane and their focus is shifting back to the Fed’s policy decisions.\"\n\nThe latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report is scheduled for Thursday. In addition, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell will testify to Congress Tuesday and Wednesday, possibly providing clues as to whether the central bank intends to ease monetary policy in coming months.\n\nThat aside, some market observers expect dim price action to continue, citing the summer holiday months.\n\n“It’s a case of more summer blues for investors,” shared Philippe Bekhazi, CEO and co-founder of digital asset services firm XBTO, in an email. “The bottom line is sellers are more motivated than buyers right now. Lots of people are on holiday, many small miners are shutting down and long-term holders are trimming their positions.”\n\n“However, the key thing here is that this pattern is not really any different to what we normally see following the months after a bitcoin halving event,” continued Bekhazi, referring to the seasonality commonly observed in bitcoin market cycles.\n\n",

    "content": "After a decade-long wait, creditors of the now-defunct Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange have finally begun receiving their owed Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin cash (BCH) via the Kraken and Bitstamp crypto exchanges.\n\nHowever, this had a notable impact on the cryptocurrency market, contributing to a nearly 4% drop in the price of Bitcoin after users confirmed the deposits to their wallets from the exchanges.\n\nOn an early Tuesday morning, wallet addresses linked to Mt. Gox initiated the transfer of $2.85 billion worth of BTC.\n\nAccording to on-chain data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham, Mt. Gox executed the movement of $2.85 billion in BTC to new wallets with the primary purpose of distributing 5,110 BTC, equivalent to $340.1 million, to four distinct Bitstamp addresses.\n\nBitstamp is one of the five exchanges that collaborate with the Mt. Gox Trustee to facilitate the return of funds to the exchange’s creditors, including Kraken and Japanese exchanges Bitbank and SBI VC Trade. Notably, Mt. Gox still retains possession of 85,234 BTC, valued at approximately $5.70 billion.\n\nWhile some users within the Reddit community have confirmed the receipt of Bitcoin returned by Mt. Gox through Kraken, Bitstamp users have reported not yet receiving their allocations.\n\nKraken had previously announced the successful reception of creditor funds from the Mt. Gox trustee amounting to over $3 billion or 48,641BTC, estimating a timeframe of 7-14 days for the complete deposit of funds into user accounts.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Mt. Gox payouts, market data analysis platform CryptoQuant has spotted the price correction that BTC has experienced over the past few hours, with the company noting that it has impacted the line of 1-3 month BTC holders.\n\nCryptoQuant emphasizes the importance of monitoring support levels, specifically highlighting the $63,600 area, representing the average purchase price of 3-6 month bitcoin holders.\n\nCrypto analyst Caleb Franzen, on the other hand, has observed Bitcoin returning to a familiar support zone, which has proven effective. Despite the temporary setback, Franzen contends that Bitcoin has displayed a pattern of higher highs and higher lows in the short term, indicating resilience amidst the current price volatility.\n\nFurther insights provided by analyst Ali Martinez point to a potential double-bottom pattern with bullish relative strength index (RSI) divergence on lower time frames for Bitcoin. If confirmed, Bitcoin could see a rebound to $67,600, contingent upon the critical support level at $66,000 holding firm.\n\nDelving into on-chain data, Martinez underscores a crucial support zone for Bitcoin between $63,440 and $65,470. Within this range, approximately 1.89 million addresses collectively purchased 1.23 million BTC, highlighting the significance of this zone as a key area to monitor in the coming days.\n\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com\n\n",

This trend was clear to see at Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville last week where a host of major announcements shed light on where the world’s leading cryptocurrency network is headed next.\n\nOne of the highlights in a conference packed with highlights was exSat’s announcement about the state of play with its testnet. Expectations for the Bitcoin scaling L2 are riding high and there’s been a broad swelling of support for the nascent infra layer. The launch of the exSat testnet was announced at Bitcoin 2024 including details of the blockchain infrastructure giants that are already onboard and diversifying its validator set.\n\nexSat is building a docking layer for scaling Bitcoin. It takes the form of a solution for extending the trust guarantees inherent to Bitcoin and adding a hybrid consensus that supports high volume transactions. The idea is to allow smart contracts and dapps to operate on Bitcoin infrastructure and inherit the network effects, liquidity, and security with which it is synonymous.\n\nexSat has developed two primary products to achieve this goal: a Data Consensus Extension Protocol and a Decentralized Indexer. The former merges PoW and PoS, combining Bitcoin’s security with staking-based governance that is more commonly associated with Ethereum. One of the keys to realizing exSat’s goal of scaling Bitcoin is onboarding sufficient partners to support this ambitious objective. And in that respect at least it has succeeded as borne out by the names reeled off at Bitcoin 2024 as exSat validators.\n\nSo far, exSat has confirmed the names of seven companies that have agreed to become validators and there’s more to come. The technical ability and resources of these initial validators alone should be sufficient to bootstrap the exSat testnet and lay a solid foundation for the mainnet launch. Bitget, ChainUp, Everstake, HashKey Cloud, InfinityStones, SpiderPool, and Treis Blockchain have all signed on as validators.\n\nCommenting on their pledge of support for the testnet, exSat founder Yves La Rose said: “These validators bring a combination of deep expertise and a unified commitment to building a scalable, secure Bitcoin ecosystem. Their diverse technological skills and visionary approaches are vital as we work together to expand Bitcoin’s capabilities and improve its overall framework, ensuring a robust and efficient future for blockchain technology.”\n\nBitcoin scaling is a multi-project and multi-year challenge that requires the support of a diverse range of industry participants, from infra providers to dapp developers. It’s too early to tell whether the resources committed to developing a scalable and usable Bitcoin ecosystem will pay dividends, but the signs are promising. As Bitcoin continues to go from strength to strength, reaching new benchmarks for price, hashrate, and transaction volume, the case for building on Bitcoin becomes irresistible.\n\n",

    "content": "Cardano (ADA) has witnessed a massive 300% surge in Exchange Traded Product (ETP) inflows. The unexpected influx of capital from institutional investors could set the stage for a potential uptrend ahead of the Chang hard fork.\n\nOn July 29, CoinShares, a leading firm in the crypto ETP industry, released a weekly report on the fund flows of various digital assets. According to CoinShares, digital asset investment products saw a relatively muted inflow of approximately $245 million in the last week.\n\nAmong the list of digital assets which recorded new flows, Bitcoin (BTC) recorded the largest increase in inflows. The pioneer cryptocurrency experienced a healthy inflow of $519 million, achieving a month to date inflows of $3.6 billion.\n\nMore impressively, Cardano recorded a surge in inflows into its ETP, totaling approximately $1.2 million. This massive inflow surge represents a whopping 300% addition from the previous week. Furthermore, Cardano’s strong performance has effectively placed it second among all crypto ETPs.\n\nSharing a “Flows by Asset” chart of Cardano and various other prominent cryptocurrencies, CoinShares reports that institutional investors have invested a total of $11 million into Cardano-oriented investment products. Additionally, Cardano’s month to date inflow has seen about $2.4 million.\n\nDuring its report, CoinShares also revealed that the launch of Ethereum Spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) witnessed some of the largest inflows since December 2020. This also led to newly issued ETFs experiencing a staggering $2.2 billion in inflows while trading volumes in Ethereum (ETH) rose by 542%.\n\nIn the case of Cardano, following its 300% surge in ETP inflows, the price of the cryptocurrency witnessed a slight rebound from previous bearish trends. Following a surge to about $0.8 some time in March 2024, Cardano’s price has been undergoing a corrective phase, declining below the $0.4 price mark.\n\nWith the Chang hard fork underway following the deployment of Cardano node 9.1.0, the market sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency has been somewhat more positive. Analysts like ‘Sssebi’ on X (formerly Twitter) have deduced that Cardano was the most undervalued asset amongst the top 10 cryptocurrencies. The analyst disclosed that investors should remain bullish on Cardano, predicting upsides for the cryptocurrency.\n\nDespite experiencing constant declines in its price over the past few months, Cardano has steadily consolidated around the $0.4 price level, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s strength and resilience during unfavorable market conditions. CoinMarketCap reports reveal that the cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.4, reflecting a 4.34% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nAnalysts like Sssebi continue to maintain a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency, anticipating future price increases during the bull cycle. According to Sssebi, Cardano is set to outperform in the crypto market, catalyzed by its booming ecosystem consisting of hundreds of Decentralized Applications (DApps).\n\n",

    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) traders expect prices to drop to as low as $50,000, a level not seen since mid-February, in the coming weeks, as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap could face billions of dollars worth of selling pressure.\n\nBTC prices have nosedived more than 10% in the past seven days, CoinGecko data shows, falling below a critical technical indicator on Thursday and erasing all gains since the end of February.\n\nTrading firms such as QCP Capital have attributed the bearish sentiment to wallet activity from a German government entity and defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox, and some market analysts say there’s more pain ahead.\n\n“Bitcoin selling pressure is unlikely to decrease in the coming days,” said Rachel Lin, founder at on-chain crypto exchange SynFutures, in an interview. “The German government still has over $2.3 billion worth of Bitcoin, Mt. Gox has more than $8 billion, and the US government has over $12 billion.\n\n“The market expects most Mt. Gox users to dump their tokens, but we might see a bounce back if the selling is lower than anticipated. On the other hand, if there is enough selling to push the price lower, we might be looking at the $50,000 level soon,” she said.\n\nAlex Kuptsikevich, a FxPro senior market analyst, echoed the sentiment in an email to CoinDesk: “Bitcoin dropped below the 200-day moving average and has so far been unable to bounce back above it, trying to stay within established patterns.\n\n“From the current position, a further drop to $51,000 (February consolidation area) is more likely than the same amount of growth to $65,000,” Kuptsikevich added. Moving averages are a measure of an asset’s closing prices in a time frame that can help identify a trading opportunity.\n\nMt. Gox started distributing bitcoin and bitcoin cash stolen from clients in a 2014 hack on Friday, sending BTC down 8% as traders reacted.\n\nIn addition, a wallet connected to the German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has moved millions of dollars worth of bitcoin to crypto exchanges since mid-June. Traders say these movements imply an intention to sell the assets that were forfeited in 2013 from a piracy marketplace.\n\nMeanwhile, BTC prices seemed to briefly recover mid-morning in Europe, rising to nearly $55,000 from a low of $53,600 in early Asian hours. The sudden drop had caused over $550 million in crypto longs, or bets on higher prices, to be liquidated in the past 24 hours.\n\n",

    "content": "The World Bank has chosen Commonwealth Bank of Australia to be the sole arranger of the world’s first blockchain bond.\n\nThe blockchain bond dubbed bond-i will be created, allocated, transferred and managed using distributed ledger technology or blockchain, which is the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum. The World Bank said that investor interest in bond-i, which stands for blockchain operated new debt instrument, has been strong with plans to launch the transaction following consultation with more investors. The World Bank didn’t provide a date for when the blockchain based bond will launch. Bond-i is also a nod to Bondi Beach in Sydney. (See more: Which Industries Will Blockchain Disrupt Next?)Blockchain To Streamline Processes In Capital Markets\n\nAccording to the World Bank blockchain has the potential to streamline processes in debt capital markets, making it easier to raise capital and trade securities. It also improves operational efficiencies and enhances regulatory oversight, the World Bank said in a press release announcing the new bond. It noted that it issues anywhere from $50 billion to $60 billion in bonds annually and prides itself on being an innovator in the capital markets. It pointed to the fact that it was the first to issue a bond in a global format in September of 1989 and was the first to launch an e-bond in January of 2000. “We believe that emerging technologies, equally offer transformative, yet prudent possibilities for us to continue to innovate, respond to investor needs and strengthen markets,” Arunma Oteh, World Bank Treasurer, said in the prepared remarks. Oteh noted that the World Bank has been working with Commonwealth Bank of Australia for several months on the initiative and is now in the position to launch its first blockchain bond transaction. (See more: How Blockchain Can Protect the Global Economy.)Blockchain Getting More Uses\n\nThe bond-i blockchain platform was built and developed by the CBA Blockchain Centre of Excellence. A private Ethereum-based blockchain is being used for the efforts but CBA said it could look at other options as this area of blockchain takes off. “We know blockchain has the potential to revolutionize financial services and markets, and this transaction is a significant step towards that future state,”Sophie Gilder, head of Blockchain, Innovation Labs, CBA in the press release. The move on the part of Commonwealth Bank of Australia comes as the Australian Securities Exchange is gearing up in 2020 to start using blockchain to clear and settle equity trades in an effort to save money.\n\n",

    "content": "Book of Meme (BOME) is the highest-growing meme coin today, growing over 20% over the last 24 hours up to $0.01046. The Solana meme coin space is growing rapidly, and Pepe-inspired tokens are following suit, with the likes of Brett and Hoppy also up double digits over the day.\n\nThe titular Pepe (PEPE) is also up almost 4%. With this interest mounting, investors are looking at a new utility-focused Pepe-inspired meme coin in Pepe Unchained, with many experts predicting over 10x returns on the token.\n\nCoinMarketCap data puts BOME as the highest-growing cryptocurrency in the last 24 hours. Hitting a spike of over 20%, investor interest is extremely high with BOME’s daily trading volume growing 172.72% all the way up to $334,522,766.\n\n\n\nAfter spending most of the week on a downward trend, BOME has bounced back growing 13.30% over the last 7 days. The token just broke out of a massive slump, with its monthly charts showing a steady degree of depreciation, with today’s spike resulting in an overall 2.16% in the last 30 days.\n\nBOME launched this year to massive hype, almost immediately hitting its current all-time high of $0.02688878. Despite the token currently trading at less than half that, the community sees massive potential in BOME.\n\nExperts and analysts on X (Twitter) expect significant growth from the token, with CryptoBoss, an influencer with over 167,000 followers sharing a simple “line go up” projection for BOME.\n\nhttps://x.com/CryptoBoss1984\n\nOthers like Dylan with over 460,000 subscribers shared more detailed thoughts, expressing faith in the coin due to its past showings of breaking through price barriers quickly.\n\nhttps://x.com/DylanTillEth/status/1817867314886295915\n\nHowever, BOME isn’t the only Pepe-inspired token growing today.\n\nBrett (BRETT) – the meme mascot of the Base blockchain grew 11.55% over the last 24 hours, trading at $0.1435 per token. With Base being one of the fastest-growing blockchains, it’s no surprise investors see potential in BRETT.\n\n\n\nDespite this rally, BRETT remains slightly negative overall, down 0.44% over the week, and 9.46% across the last 30 days.\n\nHoppy- a smaller Pepe-inspired project pumped 20.70% in the last 24 hours trading at $0.00009938 per token. However, the pump seems to be nearing its end, with the token’s daily trading volume dropping by 39.80% to $1,464,985.\n\nOn a weekly scale, this growth amounts to a 4.17% increase in value, and the coin is still a little down over the month dropping 3.41.\n\nPart of this growth is due to the overall market moving up, with bitcoin growing 2.87% to $69,681.08 per BTC. This tends to move altcoins, and especially meme coins up a few percentage points.\n\nPepe-related coins also have the benefit of growing with memeable current events, and with the US election debate heating up, there’s more room for them to capitalize.\n\nAmidst the hype, investors looking for the next 10x coin have found their next target.\n\nPepe Unchained (PEPU) is the next step of evolution after BOME. The L2 project aims to combine Pepe’s memetic value with much-needed utility.\n\nPEPU is looking to create the definitive ETH meme coin development environment with minimal transaction fees, 100x faster speeds than ETH, and a dedicated block explorer.\n\n\n\nPepe Unchained has already raised over $6 million in the presale, showing strong investor interest.\n\nSelling for $0.0087344 per token, PEPU is extremely friendly to early investors, with 20% of the 8 billion token supply allocated to the presale and 30% allocated to staking with a 312% P/A. Another 20% is allocated to marketing ensuring PEPU stays a popular investment.\n\nPEPU has had the attention of experts ever since the presale started. 99Bitcoins, a YouTube channel with over 700,000 subscribers has been steadily covering the coin. They anticipate 10x-100x growth and see the potential for PEPU to become the next Pepe come its dex launch.\n\nIs PEPE UNCHAINED The Next 10X Meme Coin? $PEPU Raises $4,000,000\n\nThere’s less than a day left until the next price increase, so investors will need to act fast to get in at the current price.\n\nVisit Pepe Unchained Presale\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain has been flexing its muscles in several industries, but the automotive sector offers immense untapped potential.\n\nIn order for autonomous cars to enter the mainstream, they must continue to improve their ability to collect and communicate data from their surrounding environment. To maintain safety, driverless cars must constantly be aware of conditions on the road, their own condition, and the status of other cars. Using blockchain\u0027s decentralized ledger, driverless cars could have access to key traffic data almost simultaneously and more accurately. Enabled by blockchain technology, smart contracts could simplify many aspects of driving, such as paying for car insurance, repairs, and tolls.\n\nIn its 2021 annual automated vehicle survey, the American Automobile Association (AAA) found that only 14% of drivers would trust riding in a vehicle that drives itself.\n\n",
    "content": "The future’s cars have long since moved from our imagination into the real world. High-profile successes and failures have created a polarized discussion surrounding the industry’s outlook, but no conclusions have emerged.\n\nAs more automakers contemplate the direction of the industry, there are still too many unanswered questions. For one, companies continue to focus exclusively on their cars, and not on the ecosystem they drive in. Even so, the emergence of blockchain as a viable way to store and communicate data seamlessly is a promising addition to the equation.\n\nThe key ingredient in successful autonomous vehicle deployment is creating environments that foster two-way communication between cars and their supporting infrastructure. While the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities have taken this in a positive direction, blockchain technology delivers a significant upgrade that could revolutionize the future of driving.\n\nConnecting Cars and Cities\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to autonomous cars entering the mainstream is the fact that they are still not connected enough to their surrounding environment. While cars can perceive millions of data points per second, they must view them in isolation and without context.\n\nUsing IoT devices improves this functionality significantly as they can collect and communicate crucial contextual data to cars to improve their performance. This includes information about road conditions, traffic accidents, and other cars on the road that could affect a vehicle’s ability to drive.\n\nEven so, IoT devices remain bound by the limitations current technology imposes on them. Centralization makes data vulnerable, and the inability to communicate data rapidly between points reduces its usefulness in real-time situations. However, blockchain technology can significantly enhance the status quo.\n\nSAE International’s Levels of Driving Automation for On-Road VehiclesSource: SAE InternationalBlockchain Advantages\n\nAn advantageous benefit blockchain brings to the table is the ability to spread data more efficiently and rapidly. Driverless cars must constantly be aware of a few key factors: the conditions on the road, their own condition, and the status of other cars. Traditional IoT makes this process complex because of its communication protocols.\n\nBlockchain’s decentralized ledger means that each node in the network—in this case each car and data point—has access to all data almost simultaneously, and more accurately. Companies are already working on integrating better vehicle tracking and communication to improve overall connectivity. Creating decentralized networks that more seamlessly transfer data to all points is the first step toward building a safe driverless ecosystem.\n\nPutting Microservices on the Blockchain\n\nAnother increasingly popular use case for blockchain technology in driverless cars is improving transactions that occur repeatedly between vehicles as well as vehicles and the infrastructure around them. It may not seem significant, but it could reduce friction at several points, advance communication, and reduce traffic bottlenecks.\n\nAn important area where this will likely be employed relates to vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) microtransactions. In this model, car owners could use tokens—such as Streamr’s DATA token—to pay for data they require from other cars. This could include weather forecasts, gas prices nearby, congestion data, and more. Vehicles could then earn tokens simply by sharing their data or choosing to sell it to advertisers or manufacturers. With this strategy, blockchain creates a V2V closed ecosystem that incentivizes and rewards participation simultaneously.\n\nIn terms of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), blockchain offers cars a significantly streamlined payment ecosystem that is designed to simplify many aspects of driving. Instead of having to manually pay for multiple things—car maintenance, tolls, insurance, and more—blockchain could enable automated payments thanks to smart contracts.\n\nA shining example of an attribute smart contracts could improve is usage-based insurance (UBI). Instead of paying yearly insurance premiums that can vary thanks to murky factors, drivers could automate their insurance to be paid based on usage.\n\nThese UBI systems require significant data input to ensure accurate quotes and premiums for drivers. However, by tapping into public blockchains, insurers could instantly calculate a driver’s premium and simply execute pre-existing smart contracts to automate payments.\n\nOne other interesting application of blockchain-based microservices for vehicles relates to ride-sharing. The sector is currently controlled by ride-hailing applications like Uber and Lyft, but there is increasing competition emerging from popular ride-sharing services like Google’s Waze, which instead emphasizes carpooling over taxis.\n\nThe Toyota Research Institute (TRI) has already made some headway in terms of studying and planning for integrating the automotive sector with blockchain. TRI works with several startups to create systems that improve ride-sharing via blockchain, possibly even including car sharing for seats and empty trunk space. In April 2021, Toyota bought \"Level 5,\" the self-driving research department of Lyft.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlockchain has been flexing its disruptive muscles in several industries, but the automotive sector offers immense potential. By changing smaller aspects of the driving experience and improving the security of drivers on the road, the technology could prove a revolutionary catalyst for a more autonomous experience. As more automakers and infrastructure businesses discover new ways to integrate blockchain, consumers will soon bear witness to the transportation transformation spurred by distributed ledger technology (DLT).\n\n",

    "content": "Long Blockchain, the company which began life as Long Island Iced Tea Corp., is in hot water. Months ago, the beverage company made headlines when it abruptly renamed itself Long Blockchain. Detractors said the flailing company was trying to capitalize on the fervor over cryptocurrencies. (See more: Long Island Iced Tea Soars After Changing Its Name to Long Blockchain.)Sure enough, upon changing its name, Long Blockchain\u0027s stock price skyrocketed. Now, Nasdaq is accusing Long Blockchain of lying to its investors, and is making moves to delist the company. (See also: SEC Halts Trading In 3 Firms Linked To Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies.)As it is, Long Blockchain \"remains out of compliance with Nasdaq\u0027s rules for market value requirements,\" according to a report by CoinDesk. In order to maintain its listing in the exchange, the company must maintain a market cap at or above $35 million on at least 10 consecutive business days.\n\nMarket Cap Hovering Below Nasdaq\u0027s Required Minimum\n\nLong Blockchain has until April 9 to meet these requirement. But earlier today, Long Blockchain\u0027s market cap hovered around $31.6 million, a decline of about $2 million from earlier in the week. Today, the company\u0027s stock is trading around $3 per share. At its peak, the stock traded for more than double that amount.\n\nLong Blockchain turned heads when it abruptly announced plans to change its focus from beverages to blockchain in December 2017. Given the sudden nature of the shift and inconsistencies regarding the company\u0027s market cap and information related to investors, Nasdaq says it has reason to be concerned about the company\u0027s honesty. (See also: SEC May Crack Down on Firms Misusing \u0027Blockchain\u0027 Name.)Plans to Appeal\n\nFor its part, Long Blockchain is not taking the news that Nasdaq aims to delist it from the exchange lightly. The company is appealing the delisting decision. According to a letter from February 21, Long Blockchain believes Nasdaq \"had determined to delist the Company\u0027s securities.\"The company added that \"the notification letter stated that the Staff believed that the Company made a series of public statements designed to mislead investors and to take advantage of general investor interest in bitcoin and blockchain technology, thereby raising concerns about the Company\u0027s suitability for exchange listing.\"Long Blockchain said it \"strongly disagrees\" with that determination, and has appealed Nasdaq\u0027s decision to a hearings panel. However, because of its sputtering market cap, even if Long Blockchain wins the appeal regarding having misled investors, it may still be delisted for other reasons.

The term blockchain’ refers to a distributed database that is shared among a number of nodes of a computer network. Blockchain is unlike any other database because of how the information is stored in it. Blockchain technology is capable of storing data in blocks that are connected to each other via cryptography. If you are passionate about cryptocurrency and want to broaden your insight on the subject, you must understand the use of blockchain in cryptocurrency.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nAre you curious to explore how does blockchain work in cryptocurrency? If yes, you will get an answer to the question. But before addressing the question, you need to have clarity on blockchain technology. A blockchain is basically a decentralized ledger relating to all transactions across a peer-to-peer network. By using the technology, participants can easily confirm transactions instead of relying on an intermediary or central authority.\n\nBlockchain technology is full of potential and promise. Although it is in its nascent stage, its application is expanding with each passing day. Some of the main areas where blockchain is already making its presence felt are finance, healthcare, supply chain management, and asset management. Another important area where the contribution of blockchain technology is of immense value is cryptocurrency.\n\nUndoubtedly, cryptocurrency is among the most popular and prominent blockchain application areas. Blockchain in cryptocurrency is responsible for powering popular cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. In fact, cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology to keep a tab on all the transactions involving currency holders. Are you still having the question – how does blockchain work in cryptocurrency? You need to get familiar with the key features of blockchain before diving any deeper.\n\nBegin your blockchain journey now with the Blockchains Fundamentals Free Course\n\nBlockchain technology has a number of features that help it stand out from other kinds of new and emerging technologies. The core features of the technology make it a perfect digital tool in the cryptocurrency domain.\n\nBlockchain is a permanent network that cannot be altered. After the recording of a transaction takes place on blockchain, it is not possible to modify or remove it. Hence, it acts as a ledger that cannot be tampered with. The immutable dimension of blockchain in cryptocurrency is of immense value. Any record that has been validated on the blockchain network stays on it as there is no way of changing, editing, or eliminating it.\n\nAs blockchain is a distributed ledger, the participants within the network can have a copy of the ledger with them. It provides them with all the information about the transactions, thereby ensuring complete transparency. In the digital realm, the use of blockchain in cryptocurrency is a fundamental necessity as it promotes transparency.\n\nBlockchain is a decentralized system. It implies that no central authority exists within the network. The specific feature strengthens the connection between cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, thereby making the verification and validation of transactions highly efficient. Due to the absence of a central authority in blockchain, the speed of the transactions is high.\n\nOne of the chief features of blockchain is top-notch security. All the transactions within the blockchain network are encrypted, thereby adding an extra layer of security. In blockchain, each and every data component has a unique identity. The blocks within blockchain networks have a unique hash. Because of this feature, blockchain in cryptocurrency plays a strategic role. It enhances the level of security for individuals who engage in transactions in the crypto universe.\n\n\n\nIn blockchain, high emphasis is placed on consensus and agreement by all the people involved. Before the inclusion of participants within the blockchain network, they need to agree to the validity of the records. To successfully add a block to the network, a majority vote is essential. Without majority voting, it is not possible to add a block to the blockchain network. Due to the feature relating to unanimity, the consent of the majority of nodes is essential to make any kind of changes.\n\nThe core features of blockchain technology make it highly relevant and useful in the crypto setting. In fact, the emergence of cryptocurrencies has brought blockchain into immense prominence. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology work together, and they facilitate value transfer in the online setting. Moreover, there is no need to depend on an intermediary such as a financial institution or a credit card firm. In the absence of their presence, it is possible for the participants of the network to engage in fast and transparent transactions.\n\nIn order to answer the question – How does blockchain work in cryptocurrency? You need to take into account its core attributes. Unlike conventional banks and financial institutions, the crypto blockchain does not have to be maintained by an organization. The lack of any kind of centralization makes it highly flexible and efficient. The existence of a massive peer-to-peer network of computer systems ensures its security. Well-known cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin make use of blockchain to process and record transactions safely.\n\nCryptocurrency and blockchain technology complement each other perfectly. The highly secure nature of blockchain technology makes transactions in the crypto setting safe and reliable. Furthermore, the immutability and distributed dimension make it impossible for cybercriminals or online attackers to break into the networks. The use of blockchain in cryptocurrency is fundamental to maximize value for currency holders.\n\nExcited to learn the basics of cryptocurrency and the ways in which blockchain technology empowers cryptocurrencies, Enroll now in the Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Course\n\nNow that you have a solid understanding of blockchain, you need to explore how the technology creates value in the crypto space.\n\nWhile discussing innovative concepts like crypto and blockchain, it is necessary to learn about smart contracts. Smart contracts are also known as self-executing contracts. This is because their terms of agreement are already written in the code. In the crypto domain, especially the Ethereum ecosystem, the role of blockchain is key while using smart contracts.\n\nBy leveraging blockchain technology, it is possible to extract maximum potential from smart contracts. These contracts help automate diverse processes and operations. That’s not all! They facilitate varying operations such as borrowing, lending, and trading without relying on any external party.\n\nCurious to understand the complete smart contract development lifecycle? Enroll now in the Smart Contracts Development Course\n\nIn the globalized era, the number of cross-border transactions has increased substantially. The emergence of technologies such as crypto and blockchain has undoubtedly been a boon. By using cryptocurrencies, you can effortlessly engage in cross-border transactions in a flexible and efficient manner. Moreover, you do not have to rely on traditional banks, which can slow down the process and increase the costs of such transactions.\n\nCryptocurrencies act as the perfect tool to support cost-effective and efficient cross-border transactions. As it eliminates the need to convert currency in the global cryptocurrency setting, it definitely adds immense value for users. You can take advantage of the innovative payment medium because it facilitates international financial and trade operations.\n\nIn the technology-driven era, contentious innovation is a must in every sphere of life. The integration of blockchain technology in cryptocurrency helps by fostering an innovative and creative environment. Currently, many participants in the crypto and blockchain landscapes have been working on developing new projects, applications, and tokens. Blockchain technology serves as a catalyst and creates new opportunities to expand the capabilities of the crypto setting.\n\nThe features, characteristics, and capabilities of blockchain make it highly relevant in cryptocurrencies. It is an understatement to say that blockchain acts as the bedrock of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Both cryptocurrency and blockchain have been playing a key role in revolutionizing the financial and payment system in the contemporary era. If you are passionate about the crypto universe and want to grasp the concept of cryptocurrency, it is a must to understand the role of blockchain.\n\nStart your learning journey with top learning resources and develop the most in-demand skills in Blockchain, Web3, and other advanced technologies with Blockchain Skill Paths.\n\nIn the cryptocurrency domain, the role of blockchain technology is of utmost importance. The integration of blockchain in the crypto space has created opportunities for individuals and businesses to use new ways of engaging in financial transactions. In cryptocurrency, the application of blockchain technology ensures high security, transparency, innovation, and decentralization.\n\nBefore understanding the role of blockchain in cryptocurrency, it is instrumental to have clarity on its key features. Some of the main features of blockchain that make it important in cryptocurrency are its immutable nature, distributed ledger, absence of an intermediary, high degree of security, and unanimity.\n\nCurrently, blockchain technology is strategically used in crypto settings for diverse purposes. Some of the chief ways in which blockchain adds value include the development of smart contracts, the facilitation of seamless cross-border transactions, and the support of high innovation.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency environment is undergoing rapid change and advancement, the role of blockchain may further increase. The current role of blockchain has shown that it has immense potential and promise. Due to its features, its application has increased in diverse areas within a short span of time. However, cryptocurrency is one of the main areas where the presence of blockchain is immense.\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer: The article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide any investment advice.

    "content": "BNB price is holding the $565 support zone. The price is now consolidating and might aim for more gains above $590 in the near term.\n\nIn the past few days, BNB price saw a decent upward move from the $565 support zone, like Ethereum and Bitcoin. The price was able to climb above the $572 and $580 resistance levels.\n\nIt even cleared the $582 resistance. The current wave surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $597 swing high to the $568 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $582 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair.\n\nThe price is now trading above $582 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. It is now consolidating near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $597 swing high to the $568 low.\n\nOn the upside, the price could face resistance near the $588 level. The next resistance sits near the $590 level. A clear move above the $590 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $600. A close above the $600 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $620 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $632 level in the near term.\n\nIf BNB fails to clear the $590 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $582 level or the 100-hourly simple moving average.\n\nThe next major support is near the $575 level. The main support sits at $565. If there is a downside break below the $565 support, the price could drop toward the $550 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $532 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels – $582 and $575.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels – $590 and $600.\n\n",

    "summary": "Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) is the third-party creation and management of cloud-based networks for companies building blockchain applications.\n\nBlockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) refers to third-party cloud-based infrastructure and management for companies building and operating blockchain apps. BaaS functions like a sort of web host, running the back-end operation for a blockchain-based app or platform. BaaS may be the catalyst that leads to the widespread adoption of blockchain technology.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)?\n\nBlockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) is the third-party creation and management of cloud-based networks for companies that build blockchain applications. These third-party services are a relatively new development in the growing field of blockchain technology. The application of blockchain technology has moved well beyond its best-known use in cryptocurrency transactions and has broadened to address secure transactions of all kinds. As a result, there is a demand for hosting services.\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)\n\nBaaS is based on the software as a service (SaaS) model and works similarly. It allows customers to leverage cloud-based solutions to build, host, and operate their own blockchain apps and related functions on the blockchain. At the same time, the cloud-based service provider keeps the infrastructure agile and operational.\n\nAs a development in the greater blockchain ecosystem, BaaS is seen as boosting blockchain adoption across businesses.\n\nMajor players in the BaaS space include:Consumers and businesses are increasingly willing to adopt blockchain technology. However, the technical complexities and operational overhead involved in creating, configuring, and operating a blockchain and maintaining its infrastructure often act as a barrier.\n\nBaaS providers offer external services that allow a user to set up all the necessary blockchain technology and infrastructure for a fee. Once created, the provider continues to handle the complex back-end operations for the client.\n\nThe BaaS operator typically offers support activities, such as bandwidth management, suitable allocation of resources, hosting requirements, and data security features. The BaaS operator frees clients to focus on their core work: the tasks they need the blockchain for.\n\nExample of Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)\n\nBelow is a graphic demonstrating the working model of Blockchain-as-a-Service Hyperledger Cello, a BaaS-like blockchain module toolkit and utility system that provides an operational dashboard for deploying, managing, and operating a blockchain.\n\nIn fact, a BaaS provider\u0027s role is similar to that of a web hosting provider. The website host creates and runs all the website content on their own servers. It may hire support staff or sign up with an external hosting provider like Amazon Web Services or HostGator. These third-party companies take care of the infrastructure and maintenance issues.\n\nBaaS may be the catalyst that leads to wider and deeper adoption of blockchain technology across various industry sectors and businesses. Instead of creating and running their own blockchains, a business, large or small, can now simply outsource the technically complex work and focus on its core activities.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlockchain as a service is an enterprise solution to the costs of developing a blockchain for a specific business or use. Many large technology firms have created and marketed this service, and there are many more being created.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "All hype aside, blockchain technology is really good at one thing: taking out the middlemen. Leaky data brokers\u0027 days may be numbered.\n\n",
    "content": "Blockchain technology has been dragged through the muck in recent months by scammers, charlatans and comedians. A joke cryptocurrency attracted piles of real cash, a kleptocratic regime announced an ICO, and an ice tea company pivoted to bitcoin mining. (For about a minute.) In the wake of all this hype, plunging cryptocurrency prices have hardly helped matters. It\u0027s time for a reminder that, while no panacea, blockchain technology is extremely good at doing one, quite useful thing: removing intermediaries.\n\nTake bitcoin, the original token on the original blockchain, which gave people an unprecedented third option for transferring money. Prior to bitcoin\u0027s invention, one of two things was possible: handing money over in person, or trusting a middleman such as a bank to do it on your behalf. With bitcoin, you can transfer money remotely without a middleman. This is a first in human history.\n\nThe economy harbors plenty of middlemen besides banks, but projects based on bitcoin\u0027s core innovation, the blockchain, have the potential to challenge them as well. Take data brokers. These are mostly obscure, with meaningless, x-heavy names like Acxiom, DataLogix, Experian, Ameridex, and the now-famous Equifax. These firms scrape consumer data – financial transfers, social media activity, browsing history, e-commerce purchases, location data – from public sources, or buy it from digital services. (Here\u0027s everywhere PayPal customers\u0027 data ends up, for example.)The brokers analyze this data to determine everything from hobbies to credit worthiness to addictions to sexual orientation. They sell it on to advertisers, card issuers, prospective employers and whoever else might be interested. In this way, each individual consumer generates a nice stream of rent for an industry that gives them nothing in return. Equifax Inc. (EFX) earned $488.8 million in profit in 2016, $3.36 for each of the 145.5 million victims of the data breach it announced in September.\n\nAccounting for the number of players in the industry and the rapid growth in the amount of data users produce, Datawallet – more on them in a bit – estimates that in the year 2022, roughly $7,600 worth of personal information will be bought and sold per person, a quantity the firm\u0027s founder and CEO Serafin Lion Engel likens to a universal basic income.\n\nIt can only serve that purpose, though, if the money does not go to middlemen, but to the people who actually generate the value. That\u0027s hardly the case today. User data, often called the \"new oil,\" more closely resembles the new guano. These nitrogen-rich seabird feces were the most sought-after fertilizer in the world for most of the 19th century. Like data, guano was procured through extraction, rather than transaction. And as with data, the seabirds that produced the stuff were never compensated.\n\nUsers of digital services are treated a bit like oblivious gulls who happen to excrete an immensely productive resource, rather than owners of an asset they create. Blockchain technology and related cryptographic techniques could change that, giving us control over our personal data and enabling us to sell it to whomever we please.\n\n\"You have the monopoly\"\n\nDatawallet is one of the companies trying to bring this change about. The app has mostly gained media attention as a way to earn $5 or $10 a month selling Facebook likes, Amazon purchases, Uber rides and Airbnb trips. Engel expects early adopters to be college students \"who are in it for beer money.\"But the idea behind Datawallet holds a more fundamental appeal, the ability to control what Engel calls a \"self-sovereign wallet,\" which makes the user the sole owner of their data and the only one with the ability to grant access to it. Engel says, \"you have the monopoly over that data about you.\"Datawallet is just one among a slew of blockchain-based apps aiming to do away with data middlemen wherever they can be found.\n\nMedicalchain is tackling medical records, giving patients full control over some of their most sensitive information and bypassing the healthcare system\u0027s decrepit infrastructure (think fax machines) in the process. Loomia is going after smart textiles, an industry in which other players are eager to harvest and hoard heart rates, geographical movements and even more intimate metrics (think smart mattresses).\n\nMost of these projects are in their very early stages, but if they come to fruition, something unprecedented and rather strange may emerge: empty platforms, places that facilitate commerce in data, but where no one party is doing the facilitating. Henri Pihkala, founder and CEO of Streamr, a blockchain-based platform for live data streams, captures the paradox: \"we make a central place which is decentralized.\"The tech: Keys, hashes, smart contracts\n\nHow does that work? The details vary, but Datawallet\u0027s solution is generally representative of the technology that enables these decentralized platforms.\n\nKeysSay you want to sell some of your personal data – for example, your Facebook activity or Amazon purchases – using Datawallet. You and the purchaser each have a public key and a private key. Public keys are used to encrypt a message, to scramble it so that it looks like gibberish to everyone except the holder of the matching private key, who can use it to decrypt (unscramble) the message.\n\nIn order to exchange your private data securely, you encrypt it with the purchaser\u0027s public key and send the encrypted data to them. They take the data and decrypt it with their private key. If someone in the middle intercepts the data, all they obtain is an unreadable mess.\n\nHashesIn Datawallet\u0027s design, the data exchange itself happens off-chain, since the contents are both too large and too sensitive to broadcast to the central ledger (for Datawallet and most other projects, this ledger is the ethereum blockchain). What does go on the blockchain are hashes of the data. You hash the data you\u0027re selling and post the result to the chain, and the buyer hashes the data they receive and posts that result to the chain. If the hashes match, a payment held in escrow is released. (See also, Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: Driven by Different Purposes.)What are hashes and what do they accomplish? They are cryptographic functions that enable quick verification that two sets of data are identical.\n\nThey do this by distilling data down to a manageable chunk. No matter how short or long the text you run through SHA256, the hash function used by bitcoin, you will get 64 characters back. Here\u0027s the hash of the first scene of Hamlet, for example:Now if you have the text of Hamlet, you can instantly check that what you\u0027ve received has not been tampered with – no need to pore over every jot and tittle. Simply hash your text and compare it to the hash of the sender\u0027s ostensibly identical text. (This works just as well for web browser data or Amazon purchase histories.)The process is instant because hash functions are so finicky. Delete the exclamation point in the scene\u0027s first line, and that one change yields an unrecognizably different hash:This sensitivity to tampering makes hashing central to bitcoin, ethereum and their peers. Thousands of identical copies of a blockchain can be efficiently maintained because they\u0027re compared using hashes, rather than through meticulous scans of every block. (See also, How Bitcoin Works.)Hashes are also useful because data cannot be unhashed. No one using any known technology can take 91BBAB0… and wring Shakespeare back out of it. That makes it relatively safe to broadcast a hash of sensitive information to the blockchain, as Datawallet does.\n\nBlockchain and smart contractsEven though the data exchange itself does not happen on-chain, the ledger is crucial to decentralized data transfer. Blockchains are immutable public records that remove all doubt about what was traded, at what price, and when. The hashes broadcast to the blockchain either match or they don\u0027t, so buyers can\u0027t claim they didn\u0027t receive data that in fact they did. Nor does anybody need to wonder whether a hacker or spy tampered with the data en route.\n\nWithout the need for someone to mediate the exchange, brokers lose their raison d\u0027être. They are replaced by a large number of (ideally) dispersed, competing and mutually distrustful \"miners\" who post exchanges to the ledger. (See also, How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?)Miners also obviate the need for a bank: blockchain technology\u0027s main application has always been as a distributed money transfer platform. Finally, ethereum offers the ability to enforce complex contracts via this same distributed network of miners. You may have paused at the reference to a \"payment held in escrow\" above. Who\u0027s holding the money while it straddles buyer and seller?No one, it turns out. Ethereum took bitcoin\u0027s decentralized money and made it programmable via smart contracts: self-executing bits of code that live on the blockchain. If all the hashes match and all other pre-agreed conditions are met, the money automatically moves from the buyer\u0027s account to the seller\u0027s. No need for a trusted custodian in the middle.\n\nBlockchain has problems aplenty\n\nAs promising as this technology sounds, not all the kinks have been worked out. Some may never be. Start with scalability.\n\nExpensive and slowBlockchains are fat, lumbering beasts. Distributed consensus is slow and costly compared to the centralized networks that are currently in operation, so how can blockchain technology compete in a user data market that – for all its shadiness – at least works at scale?Datawallet sidesteps the problem by transferring data off-chain. On-chain transfers of data troves that might include videos and other large files \"would immediately crash the ethereum blockchain,\" says Engel. And in any case, no one would want that kind of data broadcast to a public ledger.\n\nMedicalchain leaves health records where they are, on regulatory-compliant servers in the patient\u0027s home jurisdiction. It simply provides a platform for patients to grant doctors access to their records. (See also, Blockchain Technology Could Revolutionize Health Care.)Some projects are trying to scale by tweaking the way distributed networks are structured. Streamr combines a \"reputation mechanism\" called karma with its blockchain-based token, DATAcoin, to divvy up the work. \"We need to assign asymmetric responsibilities to different nodes,\" says Pihkala, \"otherwise we end up with a situation that is typical with current-day blockchains, which is all the data goes to all the nodes, leading to no scalability.\" The nodes put down a DATAcoin stake, which they lose if they break the rules. Karma, meanwhile, assigns greater responsibility to the most reliable nodes, increasing efficiency without sacrificing too much in the way of decentralization.\n\nKochava is taking similar ideas and applying them to a blockchain it is building in-house to reduce opacity and fraud in digital advertising. XCHNG, as the platform is called, uses a reputation mechanism and a brutal form of pruning – in which most nodes only hold onto a day\u0027s worth of ledger history – to process the huge volume of transactions digital ad delivery demands. Kochava founder and CEO Charles Manning believes the platform could deliver millions of transactions per second. Ethereum can manage around 15 or so, bitcoin far fewer. (See also, What\u0027s the Bitcoin Scalability Debate?)Where do you store it?Every blockchain application faces problems with storage. Monetary transactions and smart contracts might be utterly decentralized, but the data itself either resides in centralized servers, à la Medicalchain (this is largely for regulatory reasons, to be fair), or on users\u0027 own storage-constrained devices, à la Datawallet.\n\nA number of projects are trying to enable decentralized storage, including IPFS, BigchainDB and Storj. Engel, Pihkala, and Janett Liriano, the CEO of Loomia, each mention plans to integrate their platforms with one or the other of these companies.\n\nYou still give up your dataAt some point, the quest to establish ownership over your personal data hits a wall. You can encrypt it. You can transfer it directly, shunning intermediaries and keeping it encrypted en route. You can ensure that the buyer pays the agreed amount upon receipt.\n\nBut no technological legerdemain can overcome the fact that once the buyer has your data, as Guy Zyskind (co-founder and CEO of Enigma) puts it, \"You\u0027re done. They can take your data, they can copy it, they can go off-chain and then that\u0027s it.\" Rogue employees, incompetent defenses against hacking, reselling – the unpleasant possibilities abound.\n\nYet rather incredibly, Zyskind says you can make your data available to use without actually revealing it. Through a technique called secure multiparty computation, his company is building a platform that enables data not only to be stored in an encrypted, distributed form, but to be computed over while still in that encrypted, distributed form.\n\nWith an IPFS, a Storj or a BigchainDB, it\u0027s possible to keep your data secure and to decentralize it across multiple devices. But if you want to do anything with that data – run it through an algorithm or edit it – you have to decrypt and re-centralize it. In order for a credit rating agency to calculate your creditworthiness, say, they need full access and visibility.\n\n",

That keeps most of their explanations relevant and comprehensible. Burniske and Tatar start with the origins of Bitcoin during the 2008 financial crisis and cover the basics. They also explain the crucial differences between Bitcoin and broader blockchain technology. The book then details the types of cryptoassets that have arisen, such as crypto tokens and crypto commodities.\n\nThis book also goes far beyond most of the literature by attempting to define cryptoassets as an asset class. There is even a chapter that takes on the difficult task of developing a valuation framework for cryptoassets. While the market is still too young for any framework to be definitive, Burniske and Tatar deserve praise for laying the necessary foundations. Finally, they also deal with the practical details of blockchain investing. Blockchain wallets, cryptocurrency exchanges, and initial coin offerings (ICOs) are all covered.\n\n\u0027Blockchain Revolution\u0027 by Don and Alex Tapscott\n\nThe father-son team of Don and Alex Tapscott has written \"Blockchain Revolution\" to explain the impact of cryptocurrencies. The fully open platform of blockchain technology will expand and transform what we can do online, how we do it, and who can participate. According to the Tapscotts, blockchain technology will immensely improve the delivery of expanding financial services and the safeguarding of personal identity information. Blockchain also has benefits for business contracts and the development of the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nThe book also discusses the various ways that blockchain technology is changing the future of money, transactions, and business. Don Tapscott, also the author of \"Wikinomics,\" and his son, Alex, an expert on the blockchain, carefully explain the technology. They see it as a simple but transformative protocol that enables financial transactions to be both anonymous and secure through the distributed ledger. The authors recognize that blockchain technology is still in its infancy. They do an excellent job of separating what the technology can actually deliver now from its vast potential for the future.\n\n\u0027The Book of Satoshi\u0027 by Phil Champagne\n\nBlockchain technology and Bitcoin are linked because blockchain makes cryptocurrencies possible. This book offers the writings of the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, known as Satoshi Nakamoto. As of early 2024, the general public still did not know the true identity of Nakamoto.\n\nThe Nakamoto persona has only a virtual existence, much like its cryptocurrency creation. The persona is present only in the online publications Nakamoto offered to explain Bitcoin during the earliest days of its introduction. The Book of Satoshi is a definitive collection of Nakamoto\u0027s essential writings, including the original paper detailing the idea of Bitcoin. The book also contains Nakamoto\u0027s explanation of how Bitcoin works and a chronologically organized collection of Nakamoto\u0027s emails and online forum posts.\n\n\u0027The Basics of Bitcoins and Blockchains\u0027 by Antony Lewis\n\nAntony Lewis, formerly of early cryptocurrency exchange itBit, has been an expert in the cryptocurrency and blockchain spaces for nearly a decade. In this book, Lewis clearly and concisely breaks down the technical aspects of blockchain technology in a way that is digestible and understandable for those within and outside of the space. While this book also covers the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies as well, it is also a useful guide for those particularly interested in blockchain technology and its many applications.\n\n\u0027The Blockchain Developer\u0027 by Elad Elrom\n\nWhile other books on this list provide a general overview of blockchain technology, this book is written with developers in mind. As such, The Blockchain Developer does not shy away from technical discussion and granular, detailed information. After introducing the technology and its structure, author Elad Elrom discusses the process of creating your own blockchain, building dApps, and more. There are specialized sections of the book relating to popular existing blockchains for developers interested in creating apps for preexisting networks, as well as a portion of the book about blockchain applications outside of cryptocurrency.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain is the technology that undergirds the cryptocurrency world, but its potential uses extend much farther.\n\nBlockchain technology has far-reaching applications across many industries. Blockchain is already used to facilitate identity management, smart contracts, supply chain analysis, and much more. The full potential of blockchain technology likely remains to be discovered, but it is likely to be used in conjunction with emerging technologies.\n\nCross-border payment processing is one of the most promising and talked-about areas of blockchain technology application.\n\n",
    "content": "Cryptocurrencies of all types make use of distributed ledger technology known as blockchain. Blockchains act as decentralized systems for recording and documenting transactions that involve digital currency. Put simply, blockchain is a transaction ledger that maintains identical copies across each member computer within a network. The fact that the ledger is distributed across each part of the network helps to facilitate the security of the blockchain.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies grew intensely popular among the general financial and investment worlds in late 2017 and early 2018, they have since become more of a niche area for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. However, blockchain technology remains a relevant development for companies across a host of industries. It is possible that blockchain technology will ultimately be seen as the most important innovation to come out of the cryptocurrency boom. Below, we\u0027ll take a closer look at blockchain and see why this technology could be valuable to businesses of all kinds.\n\nBasics of Blockchain\n\nDepending upon the blockchain, parties may be able to view previous ledger entries and record new entries, although most blockchain networks have complex rules for adding new records, or \"blocks,\" to the chain of records. The blocks and their contents are protected by cryptography, which ensures that previous transactions within the network cannot be altered. In this way, blockchain technology allows for a trusted transaction network without relying on a central authority. It is for this reason that cryptocurrencies are considered \"decentralized.\"While blockchain is most famous for its role in facilitating cryptocurrency popularity since 2009, there are also many other non-cryptocurrency uses. Indeed, some blockchain proponents believe that the technology could far outpace cryptocurrencies themselves in terms of its overall impact, and that the real potential of blockchain is only just now being discovered. As such, it\u0027s likely that financial advisors and many others in the investing world will encounter blockchain technology much more in the years to come, whether it is linked with a specific cryptocurrency or if it\u0027s being utilized in any number of other advancements.\n\nCross-Border Payments\n\nTraditionally, the transfer of value has been both expensive and slow, especially for payments taking place across international borders. One reason for this is that when multiple currencies are involved, the transfer process typically requires the participation of various banks in multiple locations before the intended recipient can collect their money. There are existing services that help speed this process, but these tend to be quite expensive.\n\nBlockchain technology has the potential to provide a much faster and cheaper alternative to traditional cross-border payment methods. Indeed, while typical money remittance costs might be as high as 20% of the transfer amount, blockchain may allow for costs at just a fraction of that, as well as guaranteed and real-time transaction processing speeds. There are hurdles to be passed, including regulations in different parts of the world and security concerns.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nSmart contracts are often seen as a highly powerful application of blockchain technology. These computer programs, while not smart or even contracts, can initiate and automate the required actions written into an actual contract. When certain conditions are met, smart contracts execute the actions they are programmed to perform. For proponents of smart contracts, these tools provide a more secure, more automated alternative to trusting that another party will fulfill their obligations.\n\nThe potential applications of smart contract technology are essentially limitless and could extend to almost any field of business in which contract law would normally apply. Of course, while highly touted, smart contracts are not a magical substitute for old-fashioned diligence. In fact, the case of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a cautionary tale and a warning to investors not to assume that smart contracts are any better than the information and organization that a user puts into them. Nonetheless, smart contracts remain one of the most exciting ways that blockchain technology has already extended beyond the cryptocurrency space and into the broader business world.\n\nIdentity Management\n\nOne of the most problematic results of the Internet age has been identity security. As diligent as many individuals and organizations are in maintaining their online identities and securing private information, nefarious actors are always looking to steal and profit from these digital items. Blockchain technology has already demonstrated the potential to transform the way that online identity management takes place.\n\nBlockchain offers a tremendous level of security, thanks to independent verification processes that take place throughout member computers on a blockchain network. In digital currency cases, this verification is used to validate transactions before they are added to the chain. This mechanism could just as easily be applied to other types of verification procedures, including identity verification and other applications.\n\nThe applications for blockchain and identity management are wide-ranging. For instance, blockchain could potentially be used to aid in maintaining voter information and ensuring the proper functioning of the electoral process. It could also be used to securely and efficiently transfer user data across platforms and systems. Additionally, it could act as a way to maintain and protect real estate ownership records, titles, and more.\n\nSupply Chain Uses\n\nFor many businesses across various industries, a key to success is a well-functioning, efficient supply chain. Blockchain technology has already been used in multiple industries as a means of keeping tabs on supply chains and ensuring their efficiency. This could eliminate human work and the potential for error in a complex and crucial process.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAt this point, blockchain is a technology with an exceptionally broad set of potential uses. Although it is most famous for its connections to cryptocurrency, several other applications have already been explored. Perhaps even more exciting, though, is that new ways of utilizing blockchain emerge daily.\n\nWhether you are directly involved in the digital currency space or not, it\u0027s essential to develop an understanding of blockchain and how it may be used in the future.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

    "title": "Which Industries Will Blockchain Technology Disrupt Next?",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Proponents of blockchain believe in the technology’s disruptive potential. Find out which industries blockchain is likely to disrupt in coming years.\n\nBlockchain technology can improve all organizations, regardless of industry, by enhancing human resource management and accounting processes. Enterprises in the private sector, from insurance companies to manufacturers to philanthropies, can uniquely benefit from blockchain technology. Almost every entity and service in the public sector—such as elections—could be improved by incorporating blockchain technology.\n\n",
    "content": "Even as digital currencies fade from widespread interest or become illegal or heavily regulated, blockchain technology is likely here to stay. That’s because it has tremendous flexibility and the ability to disrupt almost every industry and sector of the market. It has the potential to touch every company’s accounting, corporate governance, and human resources departments. But it may also profoundly impact sectors such as banking, cloud computing, healthcare, insurance, and real estate.\n\nWidespread Disruption Across Industries\n\nThere are some ways that blockchain technology can benefit all organizations, regardless of industry, such as:Blockchain technology can benefit accountants by automating data collection and organization and many routine accounting functions like payroll. Blockchain tech can potentially reduce instances of human error and fraud.\n\nBlockchain technology can increase the transparency of how an organization is governed through smart contracts—electronic agreements that automatically execute based on predetermined conditions. Blockchain technology can also enable shareholder voting by proxy and collaboration on proposals.\n\nManaging human resources can become more efficient by using blockchain technology. Smart contracts can perform functions like conducting background checks and verifying employment histories more quickly.\n\nPrivate-Sector Disruptions\n\nBlockchain may have a specific and profound impact on some specific industries and market sectors. For example:The legal cannabis industry is tightly regulated, which creates an opportunity for blockchain technology to make regulatory compliance for cannabis companies more efficient. Blockchain tech can increase the transparency of the cannabis supply chain, boosting the safety of the product and proving its legal status.\n\nBlockchain technology may help to decentralize cloud computing, making cloud technology’s use of computing resources and data storage more efficient. Decentralizing data storage could also make cloud-based networks more secure.\n\nBlockchain-based web browsers may change how online advertising works. Blockchain tech can enable companies to advertise directly to internet users, with consumers receiving fewer ads that are better targeted to their interests.\n\nA blockchain-based distributed ledger can track the histories, provenances, and archival materials for collectible art pieces. The arts are already being disrupted by non-fungible tokens (NFTs)—which also use blockchain technology—being used to signify ownership of digital art.\n\nBlockchain technology is well suited to making food and beverage supply chains safer and more efficient. Food supply chains on a blockchain are more transparent, which enables tracing contamination to its source to occur more quickly. Certifications like being organic could also be more easily verified, with blockchain technology providing more visibility into the supply chain.\n\nDistributed ledgers enabled by blockchain tech can enable gamers to transport personas, skill sets, and digital assets across gaming platforms.\n\nHospital systems and other healthcare networks could use blockchain technology to share data, including patient records, more efficiently and securely. Permissioned blockchains may enable records to be efficiently shared without compromising privacy.\n\nBlockchain technology could help to establish consensus among the various parties involved with insurance claims, making processing claims more efficient. The technology could also facilitate cross-border insurance coverage and payments.\n\nThere are many ways that blockchain tech can potentially improve internet security. Blockchain technology could eliminate the need for human intermediaries, significantly reducing fraud, corruption, and human error. Blockchain tech can also make Internet of Things (IoT) networks more secure.\n\nBlockchain technology can bring much-needed transparency to online gambling, potentially disrupting the ability of digital casinos to tilt the odds in their favor. Players can also potentially maintain greater anonymity through blockchain-based betting platforms.\n\nBlockchain technology can potentially speed up the pharmaceutical industry’s drug discovery, which is notoriously slow, by enabling more and better collaboration among researchers. The drug development process can become safer with blockchain tech increasing the transparency of the process.\n\nPhotographic licensing and copyright information can be managed and stored using blockchain tech. Photographers and creators can use the technology to connect directly with their supporters and control their pricing and distribution.\n\nApplying blockchain technology to real estate transactions could make transferring property more efficient. Blockchain tech can potentially record and track real estate transactions and ensure documentation accuracy.\n\nBlockchain platforms could significantly disrupt the retail industry, including brick-and-mortar stores and ecommerce. Decentralized marketplaces can enable buyers and sellers to connect directly, which could lower prices by eliminating the markups charged by retailers. Sellers could avoid fees and restrictions traditionally imposed by retailers. Potentially, retailers can use blockchain technology to enhance gift card and loyalty programs.\n\nPublic-Sector Disruption\n\nBlockchain technology is also increasingly in use by the public sector. Government agencies, more than private-sector enterprises, are plagued by bureaucracy and inefficiencies that blockchain technology can potentially remedy. Blockchain tech can also make governments more transparent and potentially less susceptible to corruption.\n\nFor example, ensuring that voting processes are fair and accountable is a major concern worldwide. Some have posited that blockchain could help to enhance this process and increase reliability and security. Using blockchain technology, voting processes could potentially improve everything from voter registration to vote counting. The blockchain’s distributed ledgers are publicly accessible and immutable, which would increase transparency in the process. However, a 2020 report from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) raised serious concerns about the security of blockchain voting.\n\nHow Blockchain Tech Is Disrupting Finance\n\nBlockchain technology, as the core component of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, is already disrupting the payments sector of finance. But blockchain tech can potentially disrupt the payments sector even further, transforming several other subsectors within the finance industry.\n\nAdditionally, some companies have already used blockchain technology to develop global decentralized prediction markets. And blockchain could help streamline data organization in forecasting ranging from traffic models to the weather. Here are the financial sectors likely to see major disruption in the years to come:Companies have already demonstrated a major interest in blockchain technology. With blockchain, users around the globe could gain access to banking opportunities that they wouldn’t otherwise have. Particularly, individuals in developing nations and without standard banks readily accessible can use blockchain to access these services.\n\nPartnering with digital currencies, blockchain could allow for instant transfers of money between countries without major fees and delay times. While some mainstream financial institutions in the United States were initially reluctant to delve into the cryptocurrency market, they were much less reticent about exploring the possibilities inherent in blockchain technology.\n\nCrowdfunding has risen to prominence in the past several years to become one of the most popular ways for individuals to raise funds for all kinds of projects and goals. At the source of crowdfunding is a relationship of trust between those seeking to fund a project and others willing to contribute donations to support those goals.\n\nCrowdfunding sites typically sustain themselves by charging fees for their services, acting as a middleman between project developers and givers. Blockchain could help reduce the need for a middleman, better connecting project managers to those willing to give efficiently.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBusinesses have already explored the ways that blockchain can revolutionize the way that:With the sheer number of industries and sectors that blockchain technology can potentially disrupt, it’s very likely that blockchain technology is here to stay. The impact on the world of blockchain tech will continue to grow as the technology also develops further.\n\n",

    "content": "The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement as Solana (SOL) approaches the $200 mark, prompting speculation about its potential to reach $500. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new entrant in the meme coin space, is gaining traction for its unique blend of utility and community appeal. This article explores the latest developments in Solana’s rise and Mpeppe’s promising presale phase.\n\nSolana (SOL) has been making headlines recently, surpassing Binance Coin (BNB) to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, peaking at $193. This surge is not only a testament to Solana’s robust blockchain capabilities but also its growing dominance in the decentralized exchange (DEX) market. With a 24-hour trading volume of $3.21 billion and a market cap of $84.54 billion, Solana is showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nOne of the key drivers behind Solana’s (SOL) growth is its impressive DEX volume, which has exceeded that of Ethereum, Base, and Binance chains combined. Currently, Solana (SOL) holds a DEX volume dominance of 42%, just shy of its March highs. This increased trading activity indicates strong market confidence and a solid user base, positioning Solana to potentially set a new annual high this week.\n\nThe accumulation of Solana (SOL) by major market participants, including whales, smart money, and smart DEX traders, underscores its appeal. Recent reports highlight that Solana ranks second in accumulation, with significant purchases observed in the price range of $177 to $185. Notably, a key wallet, previously inactive for nearly two months, recently acquired $102,000 worth of SOL at $189.5, signaling renewed interest and confidence in Solana’s potential.\n\nSolana’s (SOL) trajectory remains bullish, with analysts predicting further gains. The combination of strong market fundamentals, increasing DEX volume, and substantial whale activity suggests that Solana (SOL) could very well reach the $200 mark soon and potentially aim for $500 in the future. As the crypto market continues to evolve, all eyes are on Solana to see how high it can climb.\n\nWhile Solana (SOL) dominates the headlines, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quietly carving out its niche in the meme coin space. Currently in Stage 2 of its presale, Mpeppe is trading at $0.00107 USDT, with nearly 60% of the tokens already sold.

    "content": "Amid rising speculations about when and how Facebook Inc. (FB) is going to play the blockchain game, the world’s largest social media network has listed key job opening for its blockchain team, the most prominent one being the Head of Business Development and Partnerships.\n\nNurturing the Blockchain Startup\n\nCalling its blockchain endeavor as a startup within the company, the technology giant reiterated its vision to “scale and improve the lives of billions of people around the world.” Along with building, mentoring and growing the global blockchain team at Facebook, the candidate hired as the Head of Business Development (HBD) will “play a key role in shaping and pushing forward this vision by bringing the voice of our global partners to inform our product, strategy and investments while also negotiating and closing deals to realize the vision,” reads the job description.\n\nAdditionally, there are five other blockchain group positions revealed by the Menlo Park, California-based company. They include posts of a public policy manager, a software engineering manager in Israel, a media director and two jobs in marketing, according to CNBC.\n\nWhile Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg mentioned in his 2018 mission statement in January his interest in exploring the promising blockchain technology for its intrinsic property of decentralization, the real blockchain push came in early May when the longtime Facebook Messenger leader David Marcus announced setting up “a small group to explore how to best leverage Blockchain for Facebook.” (See also, Facebook Working on Blockchain - But Why?)Last month, Arik Sosman, a former engineer at the Palo Alto, California-based blockchain security company BitGo joined Facebook\u0027s blockchain group as a software engineer.\n\nThough the company has never officially stated anything about how it plans to leverage the blockchain technology for its products and services, the job postings indicate that it may be on course to develop “an artificial intelligence platform for the project and is considering new financial services and new ways to share information,\" adds CNBC. The use of \"negotiating and closing deals\" in the HBD job description indicates the possibility of the company planning enterprise-level offerings build atop blockchain. Additional guesses going around in the industry point to the company possibly exploring the deployment of blockchain to launch its own cryptocurrency to enable (micro-) payments on its platform, or may utilize blockchain to launch a host of innovative apps on its core social media network, as well as on its other properties like Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram.

    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "In this developer tutorial, learn how to call a smart contract from another smart contract in an EVM environment using Solidity.\n\n",
    "content": "Smart contracts are computer programs published and executed in a blockchain environment. As they run on blockchains, they can be run without a central party or server. They are commonly written in the Solidity language.\n\nOn the Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts can interact with existing deployed contracts. This also applies to any other EVM-compatible blockchain (any blockchain that was created using the Ethereum virtual machine).\n\nHere are some example of smart contracts that interact with other smart contracts:Sometimes an application needs to be split into several smart contracts. For example, I once created an application that was already separated into three smart contracts that interacted with each other, but I couldn’t publish it on Ethereum mainnet because the size in bytes exceeded the allowed limit. I had to refactor the application to split it into five smart contracts in order for the app to be published.\n\nAnother interesting use case is upgradeable contracts. Blockchains are immutable, which means it’s not possible to change the code of a smart contract once it has been deployed. But it is possible to create a proxy delegating function calls to another contract that contains the actual business logic.\n\nIf you would like to change the logic, you can provide a different target address to the proxy contract, for example a new deployed version with some improvements. It is possible to separate logic and data into different smart contracts. The logic contract could be updated or swapped out via proxy while retaining all information in the data contract.\n\nThis feature is very powerful as it allows code to be reused and some deployed contracts to be used like libraries. It can also reduce deployment costs because the contract which uses the library doesn’t need to include all the code itself.\n\nLet’s use Remix, an online web tool. Go to remix.ethereum.org to get started.\n\nCreate a file to add smart contracts to. Yes, it is possible to have more than one smart contract in the same file!You’ll write and deploy two smart contracts in Solidity inside this file.\n\nFirst of all, define the SPDX license type and compiler version. Copy and paste this part:The first contract is the “Counter,” a script to increment a number.\n\nCopy and paste this example:This Counter contract has:Compile the Counter contractDeploy the Counter contractLocate the contract at the bottom of the left panel and copy its address. For example, mine is:0xd9145CCE52D386f254917e481eB44e9943F39138You should see something like the image below:Expand the Counter contract and:This is the final result:Now that we have our first contract deployed, let’s create another contract which will use the Counter increment function. This is a mechanism like dependency injection. The caller can instantiate the contract it wants to call and knows the type signature of the functions and public variables.\n\nCopy and paste this code at the end of the Contracts.sol file:The CounterCaller contract has:Check it out the whole file Contracts.sol:Compile the CounterCaller contractNow, let’s deploy the CounterCaller contract. In the left side panel, go to the button “Deploy and run transactions”.\n\nLocate the CounterCaller contract at the bottom of the left panel and expand it.\n\nThis is the final result:This is a basic example to help you learn how to call a smart contract from another smart contract using Solidity.\n\nThere are other ways to delegate calls between contracts in Solidity. It is important to notice that a deployed contract always has an address and if you know the functions and public variables, another smart contract can call it.\n\nNow that you know how to call a smart contract from another smart contract, a whole host of use cases and abilities are open to you. You can:If you’re a developer and want to secure your smart contracts, dApp, or protocol, consider using Chainlink in your smart contract applications.

    "title": "5 Ways To Use CCIP in Your Cross-Chain Applications",
    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "Discover how to use Chainlink CCIP to create cross-chain applications, enabling a less fragmented Web3.\n\n",
    "content": "Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is a new generalized cross-chain communication protocol that provides smart contract developers with the ability to transfer data and tokens across blockchain networks in a trust-minimized manner.\n\nCurrently, applications deployed across multiple blockchains suffer from the fragmentation of assets, liquidity, and users. With CCIP, developers can utilize token transfers and arbitrary messaging to enable the creation of decentralized applications that are composed of multiple different smart contracts deployed across multiple different blockchain networks that interoperate to create a single unified application. This Web3 design pattern is known as the cross-chain smart contract.\n\nBelow are a few examples of CCIP use cases for cross-chain applications, ranging from DeFi and cross-chain ENS to minting NFTs on multiple chains to cross-chain gaming. These use case examples demonstrate the potential for CCIP to transform traditional single-chain or multi-chain applications into powerful new cross-chain dApps.\n\nAll examples can be found on the Chainlink Labs GitHub and can be deployed and interacted with now.\n\nDeFi is a category of Web3 applications that is ripe for transformation by cross-chain smart contracts. In the world of DeFi today, many applications are either deployed on a single chain or on multiple chains, with each instance requiring its own set of users and liquidity. Within each chain, there is a concept of DeFi composability and “money Legos,” with developers able to permissionless-ly connect and integrate with various protocols deployed on a particular network to create new use cases and financial products.\n\nBy enabling cross-chain smart contracts and cross-chain token transfers, CCIP takes the concept of DeFi composability and exponentially multiplies it. Because now, instead of composability being restricted to each chain and limited to the DeFi protocols on that chain, all DeFi applications on all blockchains can now be composed together in various ways to create new financial products. Applications and protocols are no longer confined to the chain they’re on.\n\nThis cross-chain composability of DeFi applications enables a less fragmented and more connected DeFi ecosystem, with liquidity, users, and financial products on all chains being available to all protocols. Using the money Legos analogy, CCIP enables you to bring all of your different Lego sets together and build financial protocols with them as if they were a single, unified set.\n\nOne particular DeFi financial service that would greatly benefit from CCIP is lending and borrowing. In today’s world, most DeFi lending and borrowing protocols require you to deposit collateral on the chain the protocol you want to use is deployed on. But many DeFi users use multiple DeFi protocols across multiple blockchains and have assets scattered across all these chains. These users often chase the best returns, adjusting their positions to maximize yield, but in many cases they have assets locked up in protocols on one chain when there are better yield-earning opportunities to use those assets on another chain. If they wanted to participate in those superior yield opportunities, they’d need to liquidate their position on one chain, manually bridge the asset to the new chain, deposit that asset on to the protocol on the new chain, and then perform the same process in reverse when they want to return their asset to the originating chain—a lot of steps just to move assets into a new protocol to chase yield opportunities.\n\nScenarios like this are where CCIP can help enable DeFi protocols to truly go cross-chain, and allow users to seamlessly utilize digital assets on one chain as collateral for a DeFi protocol on another chain, all handled by CCIP at the protocol level, without the user having to perform manual steps, or adding trust assumptions due to using a third party bridge. Using CCIP, a DeFi protocol can enable a borrower to deposit assets on one (source) chain, or transfer them directly to a destination chain, and then have those assets made available on the destination chain to borrow against. Then when they wish to stop using their assets on the destination chain, the DeFi protocol can use CCIP to withdraw their position and move their assets back to the originating chain. This is the power of CCIP-enabled DeFi.\n\nIn this example, we have a DeFi smart contract Sender.sol on the Avalanche Fuji testnet. This contract accepts user deposits in the form of a token; it could be wrapped ETH, a stablecoin, or any token that has a real value. Sender.sol has a sendMessage function, which uses CCIP to execute a programmable token transfer of the specified tokens as well as a message to a destination chain. In this case, we are sending the specified tokens to the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, with the message containing the end-user’s EOA (externally owned account):Note: All code examples in this post are illustrative and are provided on an “as-is” basis without any representations, warranties, covenants, or conditions of any kind. Use of these code snippets is governed by our Terms of Service found at chain.link/terms.\n\nOn the Ethereum Sepolia network, we have deployed a Protocol.sol smart contract. This contract receives the CCIP programmable token transfer message and does the following:Once this CCIP programmable token transfer message has been received and successfully processed by Protocol.sol, the user can then manually initiate an action to borrow funds by executing the borrowUSDC function. This function allows the user to use the transferred tokens as collateral to mint and borrow an equivalent amount of a stablecoin, such as USDC, to the borrower’s EOA. In this example, we assume a 70% collateralization ratio, meaning that the protocol will lend no more than 70% of the value of the deposited token:Once the user has successfully borrowed UDSC on Sepolia against their deposited collateral, they can then use the funds as they wish on any DeFi protocol on the Sepolia network. Then, when they are done, they can repay the funds to Protocol.sol, which will cause the stablecoin tokens to be burnt, and a CCIP programmable token transfer message is then sent back to the Sender.sol contract on the Fuji network, which will return the locked up tokens to the specified address on the Fuji network. Note that the user must first approve Protocol.sol as a “spender” of the user’s borrowed stablecoin for the protocol to be able to burn the borrowed amount, which is how repayment is implemented:The complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the CCIP-DeFi Lending GitHub repository.\n\nContinuing with the theme of DeFi and lending and borrowing protocols, many DeFi users have multiple positions held across multiple DeFi protocols across multiple blockchains. This makes keeping track of portfolios and DeFi positions difficult. There are multiple third-party platforms, trackers, and even yield aggregators available, with DeFi users able to simply deploy collateral and let these third-party platforms handle the deploying and moving around of assets to optimize yield for the end-user. While these tools are a great way to abstract away some of the complexities of DeFi so users can simply earn yield, they are not trust-minimized. The user is entrusting the protocol to earn yield and to ensure positions are kept collateralized to avoid liquidation. In addition to this, if the end-user wants to have some sort of liquidation protection, they are required to have native assets deployed across all blockchains they have DeFi positions in, ready to be deployed to ensure collateralization of loans on the positions they have on each respective chain.\n\nWith CCIP and cross-chain token transfers and messaging, DeFi protocols, position monitoring apps, and yield aggregators can be enhanced to have cross-chain liquidation protection. This means that a user can have open positions on multiple DeFi protocols across multiple blockchains, and they can then allocate assets on a single chain to be used as extra collateral in the event that one or more of the loans requires extra funds to ensure collateralization. Here’s how that works at a high level:The result of this is the user can have debt positions on multiple chains while still keeping liquidity on a single chain. The entire process is trust-minimized, with the user still 100% in control of their debt positions, and they do not have to manually withdraw and move funds across chains. Here’s how it works:Chainlink Automation monitors all chains where a user has a debit position and determines if a message for funding needs to be sent. If required, the performUpkeep function will then send a CCIP message to the vault on the chain that has liquidity, requesting funds to be sent.\n\nThe vault on the chain that has the liquidity then receives the request for funds and checks if it has enough funds to send back to the requesting chain or if it should withdraw some liquidity from a DeFi protocol (such as Aave) to ensure it has enough funds to send. Following this, it then initiates a CCIP programmable token transfer containing the funds requested as well as the message ID of the initially received message (so the destination contract on the blockchain that requested funds knows which request the funds are for):Finally, the smart contract on the chain that requested funds to top up a debt position receives the CCIP programmable token transfer, matches up the request ID with it’s original request, and then takes the funds and deposits the transferred funds into the debt position in order to increase the collateralization of the loan and avoid a liquidation:This example demonstrates how CCIP can be utilized in DeFi protocols and DeFi position monitoring applications to provide users with trust-minimized liquidation protection of their debt positions across multiple blockchains while allowing them to keep their funds and liquidity on a single blockchain.\n\nThe complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the CCIP Liquidation Protector GitHub repository.\n\nDecentralized domain name services like ENS are extremely popular in Web3, as they facilitate the translation of human readable names to wallet addresses. In an ideal world, domain name services should not be specific to one chain, but each registered domain should propagate and live across all Ethereum chains, side chains, layer 2s, and app chains. This would allow users to have a single, unified identity across the entire Ethereum ecosystem, as opposed to having to register domains across multiple naming services or using interoperability solutions that aren’t trust-minimized.\n\nHowever, to achieve this, domain name services would be required to communicate with other blockchains. Each instance of the naming service on a blockchain would need to be notified when new domains are registered, and there would need to be a way to perform “lookups” against a global name registry across all blockchains.\n\nThis example showcases how you could build a simplified cross-chain naming service application, where users could register domains on one chain and have that registration propagate across multiple other blockchains as well as resolve names to addresses across any blockchain.\n\nThe first step is to deploy the CrossChainNameServiceRegister and CrossChainNameServiceLookup contracts to the Ethereum Sepolia network. This network will act as the “home” network where all registrations will occur, and then propagate to other chains.\n\nWhen you register a new .ccns handle, the CrossChainNameServiceRegister contract will use CCIP to send a message to other supported blockchains containing information about the registered .ccns handle:On all the supported receiving blockchains, the CrossChainNameServiceReceiver contract would be deployed. This contract would receive registered .ccns domains from the CrossChainNameServiceRegister contract, and would store them in the CrossChainNameServiceLookup contract deployed on that blockchain:Finally, the CrossChainNameServiceLookup contract would be deployed on all blockchains, including the registering blockchain (in this case, Sepolia), as well as all destination blockchains. This contract would be used to store all registered .ccns handles and act as an interface to perform lookups to translate names to addresses:Using this simple design pattern, it becomes possible to create a simple cross-chain domain name service where users can register a domain once, then own and use it across multiple blockchains.\n\nThe complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the Cross-Chain Name Service GitHub repository.\n\nNFTs are one of the most popular use cases in Web3. Each NFT project is usually on a single blockchain, or the project itself has multiple deployments across multiple chains, with end-users having to mint the NFT more than once if they want to own it on multiple blockchains.\n\nWith CCIP Arbitrary Messaging, NFT projects can allow for their assets to be minted once on a single chain, paid for once by the minter, and then have them propagated to the user on other blockchains. This means users can own and share their NFT, irrespective of which network they are using. CCIP can also be used to “burn and mint” NFTs across chains, allowing users to move their NFTs from one chain to another. Here is an example of how the first scenario works:The MyNFT contract contains a simple NFT smart contract with a mint function:The sourceMinter contract is deployed on the source chain, and contains logic in its mint function to send a CCIP Cross-Chain Message with the ABI-encoded mint function signature from the MyNFT.sol smart contract to the destination blockchain:The DestinationMinter smart contract will receive the CCIP Cross-Chain Message with the ABI-encoded mint function signature as a payload, and call the mint function in the MyNFT smart contract function using it. The MyNFT smart contract will then mint the new NFT to the msg.sender account from the mint() function of the SourceMinter smart contract, i.e. to the same account address for which the NFT was minted on the source chain:The end result is that the user that minted the NFT now owns the NFT on multiple chains, and they only had to mint and pay for it once. If the NFT project wants to remain strictly non-fungible even across blockchains, this solution can also be easily modified to mint the NFT on a destination blockchain and burn it on the source chain afterwards, ensuring there is only ever one version of it across all blockchains.\n\nThe complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the Cross-Chain NFT GitHub repository.\n\nIn the past couple of years, Web3 gaming has become massively popular. However, like DeFi, gaming is very fragmented, with games and their assets usually being specific to a certain chain. But like traditional gaming, the ultimate goal or best experience is when you have gamers that can play a game together, irrespective of the hardware or software they’re playing on. Just like how a PC gamer can play games with Xbox console owners, there should be no reason why someone can’t play a game on Polygon with someone playing on Avalanche. This is known as cross-platform gaming.\n\nThis translates perfectly to turn-based Web3 games and other games that do not require fast real-time interaction. Web3 gaming suffers from user fragmentation, with gamers preferring to play on their chain of choice and use their preferred digital assets. CCIP enables Web3 games to be truly cross-chain, facilitating the transferring of assets across chains and enabling a shared game state across multiple blockchains, allowing gamers to play each other regardless of the chain they want to use. If you want to reach as many gamers as possible, then it makes sense to have your game deployed across multiple chains and design it in a way where all players can play against or with each other.\n\nA simple demonstration of this cross-chain gaming design pattern can be shown with a turn-based strategy game, such as Tic-Tac-Toe. In this example, we have a game smart contract that is deployed on multiple blockchains. Users can then start a game on their chain of choice and then share the game session ID with their friends. Their friends can then join the game from another chain if they wish. On game creation, CCIP will have shared the game details and initial state with all the other chains:Once the first player has taken a turn after initiating the game, the second player on another blockchain will see the updated game state on their game smart contract once the CCIP message is successfully processed. Player 2 will then take their turn, which will generate a CCIP message to get sent back to player 1 and update the state of the game on their chain:Player 1 will then see the updated game state and make their move once again. This back and forth of CCIP messages between chains will continue to happen as the gamers make their moves until the game reaches a conclusion and a winner is declared. The important thing to note here is that the game smart contracts on both chains both maintain the game state, with CCIP being used to send and receive messages to ensure game state is maintained across both blockchains:The complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the CCIP Tic-Tac-Toe GitHub repository.\n\nFrom cross-chain DeFi and NFTs to games that run across multiple blockchains, CCIP enables the realization of cross-chain smart contracts, true DeFi composability across all blockchains, and a much more unified Web3.\n\nIf you are building a cross-chain application that uses CCIP, we would love to hear about it.

    "content": "American investment management firm VanEck has set an astonishing price target for Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency. This forecast, which seems almost inconceivably high compared to most market predictions, has garnered significant attention. Despite the ambitious forecast, VanEck’s research team has presented a comprehensive rationale explaining why they believe such a substantial price increase is attainable.\n\nOn July 24, VanEck published a report, outlining the teams’ assumptions for a bull scenario in which BTC could potentially rise to $52.38 million by 2050. Notably, the research team predicted Bitcoin’s future price based on three scenarios during a Base, Bear and Bull market.\n\nFor the base scenario, VanEck’s team believes that Bitcoin could potentially surge as high as $2.9 million by 2050. The analysts have rooted their predictions on the possibility that Bitcoin could be utilized to settle 10% of the globe’s international trade and 5% of the world’s domestic trade.\n\nUnder this scenario, central banks may hold about 2.5% of their assets in Bitcoin, further increasing its adoption and exposure. VanEck’s team has also attributed their projected surge in BTC’s value to assumptions of anticipated global growth, rising investor demand and Bitcoin’s substantial transaction volume.\n\nThe research team estimated Bitcoin’s value for 2050 using a simple velocity of money equation that includes three key factors – GDP of trade settled in Bitcoin, supply of circulating Bitcoin and Velocity of Bitcoin in the market. While predicting a bull surge to $52.38 million, VanEck’s analysts assumed that by 2050, Bitcoin will play a crucial role in the international monetary system, capturing significant market share from major currencies.\n\nAdditionally, they expect Bitcoin to become widely adopted for international trade, transforming into a major medium of exchange and a key store of value. Moreover, VanEck believes that BTC could act as a reserve currency for different countries.\n\nThe team has noted that Bitcoin was designed to replace fiat money and could become a reliable and efficient alternative to current monetary systems, which feature “corruptible human authorities with immutable logic.”\n\nWhile the VanEck team estimated an exceptionally ambitious price target for Bitcoin in 2050, they also presented a more bearish scenario for the pioneer cryptocurrency. Under less favourable conditions, analysts suggest that Bitcoin could hit a price level of $130,314 by 2050.\n\nA target of $130,314 over the next 25 years, could be the most bearish scenario for Bitcoin’s value. This contrasts sharply with predictions from analysts at financial firms like Standard Chartered and Bernstein, who forecast that Bitcoin could surge as high as $150,000 by the end of 2024 and $200,000 by 2025, respectively.\n\nDespite VanEck’s pessimistic assumption, at press time, Bitcoin’s price is trading at $67,101, reflecting a 4.24% increase in the last 24 hours and another 4.78% spike over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A blockchain operating system uses blockchain as the platform for running a device\u0027s operating system\n\nA blockchain operating system leverage blockchain ledger technology to run computer systems or networks in whole or in part. In order to function as an OS, blockchain protocols must allow for the execution of computer code and commands from users. Initially aimed as OS for mobile phones or other connected smart devices, blockchain operating systems tout a high level of data security and user anonymity.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Blockchain Operating System?\n\nA blockchain operating system uses blockchain as a support system that runs in the background of a computer system or platform. For instance, your Android mobile or Windows PC needs a local installation of the respective operating system (OS) on the smartphone’s memory or on the PC’s hard disk, and all transactions and commands are executed locally. A blockchain-based OS captures all commands and transactions from a user’s device where authenticating, executing, and recording them occurs on the blockchain.\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain Operating Systems\n\nBeyond the standard payment processing system of the popular Bitcoin cryptocurrency, blockchain is finding extensive use all across the technology stack. The emerging fad among the technical development on distributed ledger technology is the blockchain operating system.\n\nA blockchain essentially works as a ledger turned transaction processing engine. Whether you need a payment processed, or you need to arm your cryptokitty with the latest gadget on the Ethereum platform, or if you want to track your high-cost wine shipment right from the vineyard to your doorstep on the VeChain blockchain, all such applications of blockchain are based on authenticating, recording, and processing transactions.\n\nAny standard operating system, be it Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac, or mobile systems like Android or iOS, also executes transactions based on user commands issued through mouse-clicks or screen-taps where all the tasks get completed locally on the device. The same concept is extended to the use of a blockchain for device OS, where its use for working as an operating system is seen as a more efficient OS.\n\nExamples of Blockhain OS Efforts\n\nEarly attempts to build blockchain-based OS first emerged for mobile and smartphone use, and it was a cloud-based virtual system. All the necessary transaction processing occurs on the cloud-hosted blockchain-based data center, with the user only issuing necessary commands through the taps on the device touchscreen.\n\nFor instance, Hong Kong-based NYNJA Group Ltd. has a strategic collaboration with Amgoo smartphone makers for its blockchain-based NYNJA virtual operating system (vOS). The two companies will work with telecom operators in Latin America to provide NYNJA vOS users with an initial block of data upon activation. The vOS supports a communication layer offering text, voice, video conferencing, and project management tools, a secure payments layer for commercial transactions, and a multi-currency wallet that supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all ERC-20 compatible tokens.\n\nThe OS platform also supports a marketplace for commercial activities—like allocating the skilled ‘gig economy workers to specific job demands from the users, and a market for users to buy and sell goods. The vOS is supported by its native cryptocurrency called NYNJAcoin or NYN.\n\nSpecial Considerations\n\nAll benefits and advantages of blockchain are expected to be available to blockchain OS users.\n\nWhatever a user does on their Android or iOS mobiles, or Windows or Mac PCs is prone to be captured by the respective apps, ISPs, as well as OS manufacturers who may record all user activities in the OS logs. Blockchain-based OS offers benefits of security and privacy, and the de-regulated, decentralized use of OS.\n\nThe concept is still evolving, and real-world use is limited. However, if it succeeds in offering a smooth and clutter-free working of the device OS, it may not be too far to see more and more devices running on such blockchain OS.\n\n",

    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "In this technical tutorial, learn how to deploy smart contracts on the Solana blockchain that use Chainlink Price Feeds to access secure market data.\n\n",
    "content": "If you want to learn how to develop Solana smart contracts and programs, then you’ve come to the right place.\n\nSolana is an emerging high-performance, permissionless blockchain that offers fast, cheap, and scalable transactions and supports smart contracts being built with the Rust, C++, and C programming languages.\n\nIn this technical article, we’ll go through examples of writing, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts on the Solana Devnet cluster, as well as how to use Chainlink Price Feeds in your Solana smart contracts.\n\nSolana is a high-performance blockchain capable of thousands of transactions per second and sub-second block times. It achieves this via a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism that makes use of a new innovative cryptographic function called Proof of History.\n\nProof of History (PoH) establishes a cryptographically verifiable order of events (in this case transactions) over time via the use of a high-frequency verifiable delay function, or VDF. Essentially this means PoH is like a cryptographic clock that helps the network agree on time and ordering of events without having to wait to hear from other nodes. Much like how an ancient water clock can record the passage of time by observing rising water levels, Proof of History’s sequential outputs of constant hashed blockchain state give a verifiable order of events over time.\n\nThis helps the performance of the network by allowing the ordered events to then be processed in parallel, as opposed to a traditional blockchain scenario where a single process verifies and bundles up all the transactions to be included in the next block.\n\nA simple analogy would be to imagine a large 100-piece puzzle. In a normal scenario it would take one or more people a certain amount of time to complete the puzzle. But imagine if beforehand the puzzle pieces were all stamped with a number corresponding to their position, from top left to bottom right of the puzzle, and laid out in a line in sequential order. Because the exact order of puzzle pieces and their position in the puzzle is known beforehand, the puzzle can be solved quicker by having multiple people focus on a section each. This is the effect that having a verifiable sequence of events over time has on the consensus mechanism; it allows the processing to be broken up into multiple parallel processes.\n\nSolana offers a different smart contract model to traditional EVM-based blockchains. In traditional EVM-based chains, contract code/logic and state are combined into a single contract deployed on-chain. With Solana, a smart contract (or program) is read-only or stateless and contains just program logic. Once deployed, smart contracts can be interacted with by external accounts. The accounts that interact with the programs store data related to program interaction. This creates a logical separation of state (accounts) and contract logic (programs). This is the crucial difference between Solana and EVM-based smart contracts. Accounts on Ethereum are not the same as accounts on Solana. Solana accounts can store data (including wallet information) as opposed to Ethereum accounts, which are references to people’s wallets.\n\nIn addition to this, Solana offers a CLI and JSON RPC API that can be used by decentralized applications to interact with the Solana blockchain. They can also use one of the existing SDKs, which allow clients to talk to the blockchain and Solana programs.\n\nIn this section, you’ll create and deploy your first ‘hello world’ Solana program, written in Rust.\n\nThe following should be installed before proceeding:The HelloWorld program is a smart contract that prints output to the console and counts the number of times the program has been called for a given account, storing the number on-chain. Let’s break down the code into separate sections.\n\nThe first section defines some standard Solana program parameters and defines an entry point for the program (the ‘process_instruction’ function). In addition to this, it uses borsh for serializing and deserializing parameters being passed to and from the deployed program.\n\nThe process_instruction function accepts the program_id, which is the public key where the program is deployed to, and accountInfo, which is the account to say hello to.\n\nThe ProgramResult is where the main logic of the program resides. In this case, it simply prints a message, then selects the accounts by looping through ‘accounts’. However, in our example there will only be one account.\n\nNext, the program checks to see if the account has permission to modify the data for the specified account.\n\nFinally, the function takes the existing account’s stored number, increases the value by one, writes the result back, and displays a message.\n\nThe first step is to clone the repository.\n\nOnce this is done, you can then set your current environment to devnet. This is the test network for Solana developers writing and testing smart contracts.\n\nNext, you need to create a new keypair for your account. This is required to interact with deployed programs (smart contracts) on the Solana devnet. Take note: this is an insecure method for storing keys and should only be used for demo purposes. You will be prompted to enter in a passphrase for security reasons.\n\nNow that you’ve created an account, you can use the airdrop program to obtain some SOL tokens. You will need some lamports (fractions of SOL tokens) to deploy your smart contract. This command requests SOL tokens into your newly generated account:You’re now ready to build the hello world program. You can build it by running the following commandOnce the program has been built, you can then deploy it to devnet. The previous command’s output will give you the command that you need to run, but it should look something similar to the following:The end result is that you have successfully deployed the hello world program to devnet with an assigned program Id. This can then be checked on the Solana Devnet explorer.\n\nTo interact with the deployed program, the hello-world repository contains a simple client. This client is written in Typescript using the Solana web3.js SDK and the Solana RPC API.\n\nThe client entry point is the main.ts file, which performs a number of tasks in a specific order, most of which are contained within the hello_world.ts file.\n\nFirst, the client establishes a connection with the cluster by calling the ‘establishConnection’ functionIt then calls the ‘establishPayer’ function to ensure there is an account available to pay for transactions, and creates one if required.\n\nThe client then calls the ‘checkProgram’ function, which loads the keypair of the deployed program from ./dist/program/helloworld-keypair.json and uses the public key for the keypair to fetch the program account. If the program doesn’t exist, the client stops with an error. If the program does exist, it will create a new account with the program assigned as its owner to store the program state, which in this case is the number of times the program has been executed.\n\nThe client then builds up and sends a ‘hello’ transaction to the program by calling the ‘sayHello’ function. The transaction contains an instruction that holds the public key of the helloworld program account to call, and the account to which the client wishes to say hello to. Each time the client performs this transaction to an account, the program increments a count in the destination account’s data storage.\n\nFinally, the client queries the account’s data to retrieve the current number of times the account has had the sayHello transaction called, by calling ‘reportGreetings’Before you can run the client to read data from your deployed program, you need to install the client dependencies.\n\nOnce this is done, you can start the client.\n\nYou should see output showing your program successfully being executed, and it should display the number of times the account has been greeted. Subsequent runs should increase this number.\n\nCongratulations, you’ve deployed and interacted with a Solana smart contract on the devnet network! Now we’ll dive into another example Solana program and client, except this time we’ll make use of Chainlink Price Feeds.\n\nThe ecosystem of DeFi apps on Solana is growing at an accelerating rate. In order to power basic DeFi mechanisms and execute key on-chain functions, such as issuing loans at fair market prices or liquidating undercollateralized positions, these dApps need access to highly reliable and high-quality market data.\n\nSolana has integrated Chainlink Price Feeds on the Solana Devnet, offering developers highly decentralized, high-quality, high-speed price reference data updates for building hybrid smart contracts.\n\nWhen combined with Solana’s ability to support up to 65,000 transactions per second and its extremely low transaction fees, Chainlink Price Feeds have the potential to empower DeFi protocol infrastructure that can compete with traditional financial systems in terms of trade execution and risk management quality.\n\nIn this next code example, we’ll deploy and interact with a Solana program that makes use of Chainlink Price Feeds on the Solana devnet cluster.\n\nThe Solana Starter Kit is a pre-packaged repository that contains a smart contract that simply connects to a Chainlink Price Feed account on devnet, and retrieves and stores the latest price of the specified price pair into an account, which is then read by an off-chain client. The starter kit uses the Anchor framework, a framework that helps abstract some of the complexities with building smart contracts on Solana.\n\nChainlink Price Feeds on Solana all utilize a single program, with each individual price feed being a separate account that stores price updates using the program. The way this demo works is an off-chain client passes in an account to the on-chain program, the on-chain program then obtains the latest price for the specified price feed, and stores the value in the passed in account. Finally, the off-chain client then reads the price data from the account.\n\nThe first section of the the smart contract consists of normal includes and declaring using the Anchor framework. It also declares the program ID as required by Anchor. In addition to this, a struct is defined for storing price feed answers into the passed in account, as well as a `fmt` function for formatting the price data retrieved.\n\nNext, the program declares a `chainlink_solana_demo` module to be used for obtaining price data, which contains the `execute` function.\n\nThe `execute` function is the part of the program that contains the main logic for the smart contract. It retrieves the latest round data from the specified feed address by calling the `latest_round_data` function from the chainlink-solana package, which gets imported from GitHub via the Cargo.toml file. The function finishes by formatting and storing the price against the specified account passed into the program, and writing the result out to the program output.\n\nThe first step is to clone the repository.\n\nhttps://github.com/smartcontractkit/solana-starter-kitOnce this is done, you can install the required dependencies, including the Anchor framework.\n\nNote for Apple M1 chipsets: You will need to perform an extra step to get the Anchor framework installed manually from source, as the NPM package only support x86_64 chipsets currently, please run the following command to install it manually:Next, you need to create a new keypair for your account. This is required to interact with deployed programs (smart contracts) on the Solana devnet cluster. Again, this is an insecure method for storing keys, and should only be used for demo purposes. You will be prompted to enter a passphrase for security reasons.\n\nNow that you’ve created an account, you can use the airdrop program to obtain some SOL tokens. You will need some lamports (fractions of SOL tokens) to deploy your program. This command requests SOL tokens for your newly generated account. We will need to call this twice, because the Devnet faucet is limited to 2 SOL, and we need approximately 4 SOL.\n\nYou’re now ready to build the Chainlink Solana Demo program using the Anchor framework!The build process generates the keypair for your program’s account. Before you deploy your program, you must add this public key to your lib.rs file, as it’s it’s required by programs that make use of Anchor. To do this, you need to get the keypair from the ./target/deploy/chainlink_solana_demo-keypair.json file that Anchor generated using the following command:The next step is to edit the lib.rs file and replace the keypair in the declare_id!() definition with the value you obtained from the previous step:Next, you also need to insert the obtained Program ID value into the Anchor.toml file in the chainlink_solana_demo devnet definitionFinally, because you updated the source code with the generated program ID, you need to rebuild the program again, and then it can be deployed to devnetOnce you have successfully deployed the program, the terminal output will specify the program ID of the program, it should match the value you inserted into the lib.rs file and the Anchor.toml file. Once again, take note of this Program ID, as it will be required when executing the client. This can then be checked on the Solana Devnet explorer.\n\nTo interact with the deployed program, the Chainlink Solana Demo repository contains a client written in JavaScript using the Anchor framework and the Solana web3 API.\n\nThe client is a JavaScript script that takes two parameters, a deployed program ID, and a Price Feed account address. It then creates a connection to the deployed program and passes in the specified price feed account and an account to store the retrieved price data. Once the on-chain program execution has completed, it simply reads the price data from the account that was passed into the program.\n\nFirst, the client establishes a connection with the cluster using Anchor and sets up some required parameters, such as pulling in command line arguments and setting of default values:After this, the main function of the client is defined. This is the function that does everything described above. First, it connects to our deployed program using the Anchor framework. It then generates a new account and calls the `execute` function in the deployed program, passing in the following details:The client then waits to get a confirmed transaction and then outputs the program output onto the console. This displays information about the transaction, including the printed output from the on-chain program. Finally, the program reads the price data from the priceFeed account that was passed into the program, and then outputs the value to the console.\n\nThe first step is to set the Anchor environment variables. These are required by the Anchor framework to determine which Provider to use, as well as which Wallet to use for interacting with the deployed program. In this case, we’re setting the value to the default devnet provider URL, and the wallet that we created earlier:Once this is done, we are ready to run the JavaScript client. Be sure to pass the program ID obtained from the previous steps by using the –program flag linking to the json file containing the account that owns the program. We also need to pass in the Chainlink feed address that we wish to query. This can be taken from the Chainlink Solana Feeds page, and the value will be defaulted to the devnet SOL/USD feed address if you don’t specify a value. In this example, we’re explicitly specifying the SOL/USD feed to show how the feed parameter works:You should see output showing the client successfully being executed, and it should display the latest price from the specified price feed, stored in the new account:Solana offers a high-speed, low-cost, scalable blockchain for building smart contracts and decentralized applications. By leveraging Solana smart contracts and Chainlink Price Feeds, developers can create fast, scalable DeFi applications, taking advantage of the high-quality data offered by Chainlink Price Feeds and the high-speed updates available on the Solana blockchain.\n\nTo explore more Chainlink technical tutorials, check out the engineering video tutorials playlist on the official Chainlink YouTube, and visit the Chainlink documentation at docs.chain.link.

    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "The verifiable web uses blockchains, oracles, and cryptography to give users proof about how systems work and control over their data, identities, and assets.\n\n",
    "content": "Definition: The verifiable web uses blockchain technology, decentralized computing, and cryptography to enforce contractual obligations, provide greater transparency into how systems work, and give users more control over their data, identities, and assets.\n\nIn early civilizations, truth was based on myth. Observations of worldly phenomena were wrapped in symbolic narratives, religious beliefs, and ancient wisdom. Over time, humanity began to value objective measurements and reasoning, birthing disciplines such as science, mathematics, and logic.\n\nAfter the invention of the written word and, later, the printing press, books and documents captured the world’s information in written form, from academic literature and legal contracts to statistics and opinionated analysis. Then, in the twentieth century, phones, computers, and the Internet started a digital revolution in how information was created, distributed, and verified, with supercomputers now performing large-scale computations on complex data sets and billions of users across the globe generating, sharing, and talking about content every day in real-time.\n\nNow, with a simple Internet connection, anyone in the world can instantly access a seemingly infinite flow of information. But while individuals are now empowered to consume and share more information than ever before, high-velocity, high-volume information scattered across a variety of applications poses extraordinary challenges: How can an everyday user make sense of such a vast, complex, and sometimes contradictory information landscape? Information warfare and advancements in AI are only compounding this problem.\n\nInformation is the basis for sound decision-making by humans, institutions, and systems, and we need a better foundation for obtaining and evaluating it. This new foundation starts by increasing people’s ability to verify the source of information, the method used to calculate it and the integrity of the systems used to do so, and the historical reputation of these sources, methods, and systems. Doing so will require the creation of a more advanced informational and digital age powered by cryptographic truth. We call this the verifiable web.\n\nIn the established web model, the Internet is shared networking infrastructure that enables communication between computers via online applications. Each online application handles its own computing (executing code), storage (storing code and data used and produced), and management (updating code and maintaining a successful business) by either running it in-house or outsourcing it to a centralized company. Users of applications are then responsible for establishing a connection to the Internet in order to interact with the online application, generally by paying for a data or Internet plan.\n\nThe problem with this model is it directly or indirectly gives centralized entities— whether it’s the application or Internet Service Provider (ISP)—extensive control over online data, computing, and/or networking. This means how the application works can be arbitrarily changed at any time—a social media company quietly changing its algorithm, for example. It also means that user data and connectivity can be arbitrarily censored, omitted, or monetized for personal gain, oftentimes with little user oversight or awareness of how it’s being done. As a result, the user has to trust the application and Internet infrastructure to act in a reliable and honest manner because they have no actual guarantees—just paper promises that take time and money to fight against in court if broken (assuming the user even has access to a high-integrity legal system).\n\nWith the web extending far beyond information-sharing applications to span financial transactions, health management, election systems, supply chain tracking, and more, fixing it means fixing the nature of almost every digital interaction the modern user has. The stakes couldn’t be higher.\n\nThe verifiable web is not a replacement for the established web but rather an extension of its capabilities. The verifiable web provides applications with a decentralized, cryptographically secure, and verifiably fair environment for running computations, storing data, governing operations, and facilitating networking across systems.\n\nWith some or all of an application’s backend infrastructure run on the verifiable web, users are able to obtain proof and guarantees about the application and its data, such as that it’s manipulation-resistant (secure), always available (reliable), permissionlessly accessible (censorship-resistant), logically sound (accurate), authenticated (genuine), private (privacy), and traceable from inception (provenance).\n\nInstead of requiring users to trust that an online application will keep its commitments, the verifiable web provides technologically enforced guarantees that users can independently check.\n\nBy knowing how an application works and that it cannot arbitrarily change, users can make more informed decisions about whether or not to engage with it and whether to disengage at any point in the future. This is because the user is able to know its state at all times with near-complete certainty, including how it makes decisions, how rules are enforced, how data is generated, and what updates will be made.\n\nThe verifiable web is underpinned by game-theoretical design—using the science of strategy to produce desired outcomes. The verifiable web combines various technologies to create game-theoretical environments where rational participants are incentivized to produce fair outcomes (i.e., it’s deterministic), even in the presence of adversaries. Furthermore, users can inspect these environments to check if they meet their own standards of trust and fairness. In contrast, the established web relies on trust in probabilistic and unverifiable promises made by the centralized entity that owns the application or runs its backend infrastructure.\n\nFor example, central banks manage monetary policy based on subjective assessments while banks manage payment ledgers with relative opaqueness. While there are various reasons for doing so, it is a less predictable process that can create systemic risk. Alternatively, Bitcoin uses a game-theoretical design to incentivize a decentralized network of nodes to manage monetary policy and maintain a payment ledger according to a publicly available set of rules enshrined in the software that nodes on the network run. This provides users with verifiable proof about how the ledger is managed and how difficult it is to tamper with the ledger and alter the monetary policy, ultimately creating more predictable risk management.\n\nThe verifiable web is what crypto is really about—it starts with fixing money and financial markets, before expanding into other industries to bring greater proof and transparency to the digital interactions that determine our lives. If trust in institutions continues to decrease, demand for technologies that provide verifiable proof about the world will only increase. Some of the areas of growing distrust that the verifiable web can help to improve include:Financial markets have historically been subject to boom and bust cycles as a result of mispriced asset valuations and resulting systemic risk due to their cross-dependencies. People want better guarantees that financial markets and assets are as healthy as the official reports state, and that financial services will be honored as agreed upon. The verifiable web can be an important tool in providing a golden record across market infrastructure or forcing timely and in-full financial payments, ultimately creating more stability and reducing systemic risk.\n\nWith the acceleration of AI, it’s becoming harder to distinguish between real and fake images and videos. The spread of fake content is leading to the proliferation of false narratives in society, and, as a side effect, increased skepticism in legitimate sources. The verifiable web can play a key role in authenticating the source of images and videos, such as a camera cryptographically signing a photo/video with a unique private key from an HSM hardware module and then hashing a copy onchain as a tamperproof record of who took the photo/video and when it was taken.\n\nThe acceleration of AI and information warfare has also made it hard to filter misinformation and disinformation and decide who to turn to for unbiased analysis. The verifiable web can not only help create a single, globally accessible source of truth about the origin of information, but it can also help establish methods for verifying the track record of news sources and analysts over time and incentivize sound research and analysis.\n\nAs society has become more educated, it has also become more interested in the source and quality of food and goods. However, it can be difficult to verify the true origin of a good or that it’s authentic, hasn’t been diluted, and is backed by a manufacturer with a reliable track record. The verifiable web can help users track and rate food and goods from inception to the storefront with more certainty.\n\nHaving verifiable proof that a contract will be honored is critical to running a reliable business or purchasing a product (e.g., warranties). Unfortunately, contracts are not always strictly enforced, especially when one side has a clear economic and political advantage over their counterparty. The verifiable web can level the playing field by replacing clauses in digital contracts with technologically enforced guarantees via smart contracts and oracle networks. This can help improve trust between people, businesses, and institutions globally, particularly by making the levers that can dictate the outcome of contracts impossible for any party to tamper with.\n\nObtaining a realistic view of what the public thinks helps institutions and society at large make better decisions. AI, bot farms, and closed-source algorithms make it hard to know whether social consensus derived from online debates, surveys, elections, viewership, and more is real or manipulated. Thus, it’s important for the verifiable web to bring authentication and verifiability to how social consensus is created and gathered, such as by open-sourcing algorithms used in information collection and leveraging manipulation-resistant and privacy-preserving verification systems to prove someone is a unique human without revealing their identity.\n\nBelow is a list of technologies/technological movements that combine to create the verifiable web. New technologies are also likely to emerge as consumers demand more and more verifiable proof and guarantees about their everyday lives.\n\nOpen-source software is software for which the code that defines how it runs is verifiable by anyone. This allows stakeholders using or affected by the software to inspect it before deciding to adopt or update it. As more people independently verify it, the software becomes more secure and trusted to consistently operate in a specific way.\n\nExamples: Linux Operating System, Mozilla Firefox, and Apache Web ServerCryptography involves the use of verifiable mathematical techniques to secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. In a general sense, cryptography is used to conceal and authenticate information by scrambling it with a cipher, which cannot be cracked in any practical sense (e.g., it would require a prohibitive amount of time and investment), even with the most advanced computing technologies. Cryptography is already widely used across the modern Internet to ensure that users are able to interact with each other without worrying about imposters or middlemen intercepting their communications.\n\nExamples: One-Way Hash Functions, Public/Private Key Encryption, and Zero-Knowledge ProofsBlockchains are distributed ledgers that provide verifiable proof that the tracking of asset ownership is accurate and tamperproof, and that the ability to move assets between users is permissionless and always available. Furthermore, the smart contract applications running on blockchains provide verifiable proof that their code will execute exactly as it is stored onchain. This enables businesses to transact and governance processes to be managed in a distributed manner that is transparent and resistant to manipulation by a single entity.\n\nBlockchains make use of a multitude of technological primitives, most notably cryptography, consensus protocols, and financial incentives. As an overview, blockchains use financial rewards and penalties to incentivize a decentralized network of independent nodes to come to an honest consensus about the validity of submitted transactions and to keep the ledger updated and available. Blockchains also use cryptography to authenticate transactions, ensuring they are unique to a specific user. The combination of cryptography and decentralized consensus makes it very difficult to tamper with the network, resulting in a form of cryptographic truth.\n\nExamples: Bitcoin, Aave, and ENSOracles leverage similar primitives of cryptography, consensus protocols, and financial incentives, but for the purpose of creating cryptographic truth around any type of data, computation, or connection between systems. Whereas blockchains are only concerned with verifying the ownership and transfer of tokens or updating smart contracts, oracles can be applied to creating truth and guarantees about anything, such as calculating the fair price of an asset, generating a tamperproof and unbiased random number, or ensuring that an automated task will be completed at a specific time or that value will be securely transferred between systems when a specific event occurs. Oracles can expand cryptographic truth to the verification of almost anything.\n\nExamples: Chainlink Data Streams, Functions, and Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)Trusted hardware is hardware where the software running inside cannot be tampered with or even observed by either a third party or the hardware operator. Trusted execution environments (TEEs) often generate cryptographic attestations, which give users verifiable proof that the software running inside executed exactly as expected. Although the area still requires more research and development, trusted hardware is an extension of other types of hardware like secure enclaves and hardware security modules (HSMs), which provide a protected environment for storing information or executing code.\n\nExamples: Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, and KeystoneAuthenticating that information came from a specific person or company is critical proof for facilitating certain processes. Biometrics provide a way of authenticating that an action was taken by a specific person by verifying a physical feature unique to them. For example, phones use a person’s fingerprint as verifiable proof that they belong to the owner.\n\nExamples: Fingerprint, Iris Recognition, Facial RecognitionWhile truths or proofs may not always be obtainable in real-time, they can be demonstrated over time through the use of reputation systems. Reputation systems are methods of tracking the historical performance of an entity or process, such as a system’s uptime, the accuracy of a data provider, the correctness of an analyst’s predictions, or the reliability of a user in a help forum. The integrity of reputation systems is further verifiable when they cryptographically sign data that they’re tracking onchain, where it cannot be deleted or altered in the future.\n\nExamples: eBay, Stack Exchange, and Ethereum Beacon Chain Validator RankingsAs machine learning algorithms and data collection techniques become more advanced, so too does the ability to analyze complex datasets and come to conclusions with a statistically high degree of confidence.\n\nOne example of this is a project in development by Green World called AIRS, which aims to use satellite remote sensing data with smart contracts to successfully reward stewards of targeted regenerative agriculture. Chainlink oracles are tasked with gathering ground-truthing and satellite data, analyzing it within trusted execution environments for high-trust quantitative metrics, and relaying it to a blockchain to trigger automated payments to stewards. AIRS rewards to stakeholders can take the form of cryptocurrency—readily convertible into local currency—or digital financial instruments tailored to meet the needs of local communities.\n\nThe verifiable web is a much-needed trust anchor for society, whereby vulnerable human decision-making is replaced by unbiased software that enforces honest outcomes and provides verifiable proof of how it arrived at such outcomes. This new superpower enables builders to create applications that are undeniably fair, provably accessible to anyone in the world, and verifiably secure against manipulation. The possibilities are endless, and this paradigm shift couldn’t come at a more pressing time, with society needing verifiable truth about how the world works more than ever.\n\nChainlink is the decentralized computing platform helping power the verifiable web. From startups to leading financial institutions, builders worldwide use Chainlink to power verifiable applications and high-integrity markets. Learn more by visiting https://chain.link/.\n\n",

    "content": "Ethereum created ripples in the crypto industry with the transition to Proof of Stake consensus in 2022. Users can stake ETH with the new consensus mechanism of Ethereum and serve as validators for maintaining the Ethereum blockchain. The transition to a new consensus mechanism introduced a new design that allowed any user with 32 ETH to participate in staking. Discussions about Ethereum staking future have been gaining momentum as Ethereum faces more competition from new arrivals.\n\nEthereum has the highest market capitalization among Proof of Stake blockchain networks. The amount of ETH that has been staked now is around 32.5 million. The impressive highlight about Ethereum staking is that the amount of staked ETH has increased by 78% since April 2023. Let us take a look at some important predictions about the future of Ethereum staking.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nEthereum staking is essential for improving the security and decentralization of the blockchain network. Users staking their ETH in the network can become validators. The need to learn about predictions for Ethereum staking emerges from the fact that staking is crucial for maintaining the Ethereum network. Validators deposit their Ether tokens in smart contracts and run software for validation and proposing new blocks.\n\nEthereum staking enables users to serve the Ethereum network and enhance the value of their ETH tokens. Validators receive a reward for offering their services to secure and maintain the Ethereum network. Interestingly, the rewards for validators come with limited risks. Only 0.03% of validators have lost some of the 32 ETH they staked in the network.\n\nThe Ethereum staking future price prediction is important for validators now as the blockchain ecosystem expands with newer innovations. It is important to pay attention to ETH staking as the amount of ETH tokens in circulation that have been staked is a cause of concern. The amount of ETH that has been staked is only 27% of the total ETH tokens in circulation. Other popular Proof of Stake blockchain networks such as Avalanche, Solana and Cardano have a higher staking ratio.\n\nLearn about the basic concepts of Ethereum, such as transactions, addresses, consensus, blocks, and important tools with the Ethereum Technology Course.\n\nEthereum staking is an integral phenomenon in the blockchain landscape amidst the waves of technology upgrades and regulatory uncertainty. You can become a validator and earn staking rewards with limited risks. It is important to note that you might face additional risks with the involvement of intermediaries in ETH staking. Staking providers and exchanges lack transparency in reporting staking returns thereby increasing risks.\n\nThe uncertainty regarding ETH staking future emerges primarily from the SEC targeting different staking services. The SEC believes that staking and lending are the same thing even if they are completely different and pose different risks. Lending involves a contract between two or multiple parties for exchanging money today with the expectation of receiving money tomorrow. Staking is a service offered by validators for maintaining and securing the blockchain network.\n\nEven with the fundamental differences between staking and lending, regulators have been treating them as the same concepts. Such assumptions have led to flow of Ether from regulated US companies to DeFi projects. Therefore, it is important to keep an eye on the potential directions in which Ethereum staking could move in future.\n\nGet familiar with common Ethereum terms with the Ethereum Flashcards.\n\nThe transition of Ethereum to Proof of Stake consensus invited the need for an equitable, decentralized and secure staking ecosystem. Questions such as “is staking Ethereum worth it” have become more apparent as staking becomes an uncertain venture. Distributed Validation Technology or VDT can support the creation of a more inclusive and decentralized Ethereum ecosystem. The founder of Ethereum introduced DVT as a solution to prevent concentration of staking power among few entities.\n\nDVT has been instrumental in redefining the architecture of Proof of Stake validators on Ethereum. It can help validators work as a combined unit spread across a collection of nodes rather than on one machine. The innovative approach helps individuals and groups to empower a single validator in the Ethereum ecosystem in collaboration with each other. DVT plays a major role in improving the resilience of validators alongside reducing the risks of penalties for honest validators.\n\nThe transformative approach of DVT has the potential to democratize access to ETH staking and making it more inclusive. Rainbow staking is another notable entry among Ethereum staking future predictions that can complement DVT. Rainbow staking aims at diversification of the staking ecosystem through distribution of services in light and heavy layers. It also follows the vision for distributed validation that makes staking more flexible.\n\nRainbow staking helps validators serve specialized services according to the preferences and capabilities. The specialization of validators can create a more efficient and competitive network that offers better scope for innovation and service quality. The combination of rainbow staking with DVT can reduce most of the centralized risks associated with Ethereum staking.\n\nExcited to understand how to get started developing with Ethereum, Enroll now in the Ethereum Development Fundamentals Course\n\nEthereum upgrades are a big news in the crypto landscape. You can expect the next Ethereum upgrade towards the end of 2024 or early 2025. The most prominent proposal for the next upgrade, EIP 7251, can offer better user experience for validators. The proposal would increase the maximum effective balance of validators. It can help staking service providers increase efficiency of staking alongside reducing the costs.\n\nThe importance of EIP 7251 for ETH staking future also applies to validators who don’t use staking services. The upgrade offers auto-compounding of staking rewards. Solo validators would have their staking rewards withdrawn to the execution layer and the received rewards will not accrue any staking yield. They will have to wait until they have 32 ETH to spin up another validator for capturing the staking reward.\n\nEnroll now in the Ethers.js Blockchain Developer Course to develop an in-depth understanding of smart contracts and their uses for creating secure and efficient Ethereum transactions.\n\nDistributed Validation Technology offers more than technical resilience. It would be a major determinant of Ethereum staking future price prediction by prioritizing accessibility and inclusion. DVT lowers the barriers to become a validator and reinforces the identity of Ethereum as an inclusive blockchain. The inclusivity would play a crucial role in improving the global perception of Ethereum blockchain.\n\nDVT can help validators access staking in areas with economic constraints or frequent power outages. It expands the reach of Ethereum and enables new perspectives on innovation through the strength of multiple validators. DVT can also determine the future of ETH staking by improving accessibility in areas where infrastructural and economic challenges have restricted participation in staking.\n\n\n\nThe evolution of blockchain technology and the growth of Ethereum have been running parallel to each other. The introduction of DVT can influence the predictions for Ethereum staking as it is not a simple strategic choice. DVT can help in keeping ETH staking at the top amidst the rise of new networks.\n\nEthereum can work as a foundational infrastructure to empower innovative financial solutions. With a new bull run just around the corner, Ethereum can provide better security with DVT that offers better resilience. DVT also capitalizes on the core infrastructure of Ethereum for mitigation of risks. You must note that DVT not only improves the security of the network but also democratizes network participation. Therefore, it can become a critical necessity amidst higher market volatility and potential for losses.\n\nRestaking is one of the fundamental elements of the Ethereum network. The points program from liquid restaking protocols and EigenLayer can open new prospects to increase the demand of ETH staking. The answers for ‘is staking Ethereum worth it’ draw attention towards the performance of liquid staking protocols in 2024. Liquid staking protocols were responsible for around 38% of the staking volume in March 2024.\n\nRestaking would enhance the level of traction for Ethereum staking. The future of Ethereum staking might involve a lot of liquid staking and restaking. At the same time, you must also note that restaking has some unavoidable risks. The quality of smart contracts and the actively validated services are the top risks with restaking that you should watch out for.\n\nLiquid staking involves enabling new prospects for validators to use the deposits of other users in return for liquid staking tokens. The other users can trade liquid staking tokens on exchanges or use them as a collateral. It will enable the introduction of a new asset that has its own liquidity.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the popular blockchain network, Ethereum, and ensure overall, comprehensive skill development with Ethereum Skill Path\n\nThe introduction to Ethereum staking with the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism revolutionized the crypto landscape. On the other hand, the Ethereum staking future is limited by different concerns, especially pertaining to regulatory uncertainty. The prospects for ETH staking in future depend on new and innovative solutions.\n\nThe promising solutions to expand the scope of Ethereum staking include DVT, restaking or liquid staking. New upgrades expected in the Ethereum network might also simplify staking for Ethereum users. The future of Ethereum staking would also focus largely on improving inclusivity and accessibility through DVT.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "How blockchain ETFs work and the risks associated with such theme-based investments.\n\nBlockchain ETFs hold stocks of companies with blockchain technology-related operations or profit from the blockchain. Twenty-five blockchain ETFs trade on U.S. markets as of January 2024. Best known for underpinning cryptocurrency transactions, blockchain technology\u0027s decentralized structure has potential applications in health care and beyond. Blockchain ETFs are different from cryptocurrency ETFs, which are designed to track the price performance of one or more digital tokens.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Blockchain ETF?\n\nBlockchain exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hold stocks of companies that profit from or have business operations tied to blockchain technology. Best known for its use in maintaining decentralized records of cryptocurrency transactions, blockchain technology has potential applications across many industries, with use cases as diverse as protecting healthcare data and managing video streaming services, among many others.\n\nAs the number of ETFs available on the market has grown, investors can target an increasing variety of market areas and asset types. Blockchain-based ETFs—a type of exchange-traded product (ETP)—are one way to invest in a diversified set of companies that may have cryptocurrency on their balance sheet or engage with blockchain technology in other parts of their business.\n\nTwenty-five blockchain ETFs provide U.S. investors with access to companies utilizing the technology as of January 2024.\n\nHow a Blockchain ETF Works\n\nBlockchain ETFs offer an efficient vehicle to invest in a select basket of blockchain-specific stocks. From an investor\u0027s perspective, these funds work just like any other ETF—you gain access to a group of stocks in the blockchain industry in a single instrument that trades on an exchange just like an individual stock.\n\nThe majority of U.S.-traded blockchain ETFs are passively managed, tracking the performance of an underlying index. For example, the Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN) aims to track the performance of a specially designed index called the Nasdaq Blockchain Economy Index. This index includes companies involved in research, development, support, or utilization of blockchain technology and associated businesses.\n\nThe index methodology assigns a \"Blockchain Score\" to each potential company stock that may be an eligible candidate for inclusion. This score is based on several factors, such as how a company contributes to the blockchain ecosystem, its blockchain product maturity and associated economic impact, investments and expenditures on research and development activities, company results, and innovations.\n\nThe factor-based methodology ensures that the potential of a blockchain company and its business is gauged with higher accuracy for realistic economic profits, renovated business prospects, and operational competence. The 50 to 100 companies with the top Blockchain Scores qualify for entry into this index, and the same stocks get replicated in the BLCN ETF. The index is rebalanced every six months.\n\nSeveral blockchain ETFs opt for an active management strategy rather than relying on a custom-designed index like BLCN. With total assets over $1.1 billion as of January 2024, making it among the largest U.S.-traded blockchain ETFs, the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) is one example of an actively managed fund.\n\nBLOK ETF issuer Amplify believes its active strategy allows its fund managers to \"make timely decisions and identify companies that are best positioned to profit from the developing blockchain technology space.\" The fund commits to investing at least 80% of its assets in stocks of companies deriving significant income from transformational data sharing-related business or engaged in the research and development, proof-of-concept testing, or implementation of similar technology.\n\nWhether they use active or passive strategies, blockchain ETFs often invest in companies from the banking and financial sector, technology, IT services, hardware, internet, telecom services, and even biotechnology firms that may be using some form of data sharing or blockchain-based systems.\n\nFor example, BLCN holds stocks like MicroStrategy (MSTR), Coinbase (COIN), Block (SQ), and Beyond (BYON). BLOK includes MicroStrategy and Coinbase among its top holdings, along with Japan-based financial services group SBI Holdings (8473.T), Accenture (ACN), and Riot Platforms (RIOT).\n\nAs blockchain technology remains open and global, these ETFs include companies from around the globe. Regionally, both BLCN and BLOK have the bulk of exposure to North American-based blockchain companies, while the rest is shared by Asian and European companies in varying proportions.\n\nUse of Blockchain Beyond Cryptocurrency\n\nBeyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology is finding use in various other sectors. For one thing, the technology has extended its reach into other areas of the banking and financial markets. Financial institutions are using blockchain for international payments, equity swaps, cross-border trade, regulatory compliance, and protecting customer information.\n\nBut the potential uses of blockchain technology are not limited just to the financial world. The technology has potential in integrating health care data, tracking goods along the supply chain, and helping media companies protect their intellectual property. Even government systems involving voting and identity management could benefit from the blockchain\u0027s enhanced security and transparency.\n\nBlockchain ETF Risks\n\nBeing a theme-based investment, blockchain ETFs carry the inherent risk of non-performance, non-adaptability, or failure of the blockchain ecosystem. While there is an increasing level of acceptance for blockchain systems, the concept remains dependent on the evolution of the overall ecosystem, the reliability and stability of the blockchain network, its configuration, and its successful adoption.\n\nAnother inherent risk is that blockchain ETFs may end up investing in earlier-stage technology-based companies, which are prone to failure. While the diversification through ETFs mitigates such stock-specific risk to a reasonable extent, the risk of specific holdings not performing well remains.\n\nAdditionally, the holdings of blockchain ETFs often overlap with existing technology and internet companies. Companies included in the portfolio may derive a larger share of their revenues from non-blockchain-based products and services.\n\nFor instance, some blockchain ETF holdings might generate most of their revenues from networking equipment and computer processors, with a limited share of hardware used in blockchain-based systems. Blockchain segments may be contributing only a small part of overall revenues to such stocks, making the overall returns vulnerable to the non-performance of their majority non-blockchain segments.\n\nOne also needs to be aware of the expense ratio charged by funds and the trading charges levied by such ETF units. For example, BLCN and BLOK have expense ratios of 0.68% and 0.75%, respectively—significantly higher than a fund like the SPDR S\u0026P 500 ETF (SPY), which charges 0.09%.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlockchain ETFs invest in a portfolio of companies with business activities related to the blockchain. This distributed database technology underpins cryptocurrency transactions and has many other applications. Some blockchain ETFs seek to track the performance of specialized indexes, while others are actively managed in an attempt to capitalize on the latest technological developments.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

    "content": "The cryptocurrency industry is evolving at an impressive pace with the integration of new utilities in cryptocurrencies. Everyone who wants to begin trading in cryptocurrencies is likely to choose third-party wallets or crypto wallets. The growing popularity of cryptocurrencies has attracted cybercriminals’ attention.\n\nThe evolution of cryptocurrency sector and introduction of new security measures cannot adapt to the tactics of scammers, fraudsters, and hackers. Therefore, crypto wallet security has emerged as a top priority for crypto users. It is important to reflect on the threat of security risks for crypto wallets and how to ensure effective safeguards against the risks. Let us learn more about the best practices to protect your crypto wallets from prominent security threats.\n\n\n\nThe best way to understand the implications of security for crypto wallets involves learning about the fundamentals of crypto wallets. It can help you understand the potential risks for security of cryptocurrency wallets with knowledge of their working mechanisms. Crypto wallets are digital tools for storing, sending, and receiving cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. The working mechanism of crypto wallets revolves around the use of a public key and private key.\n\nPublic key is the public address of the cryptocurrency wallet. It is an alphanumeric string that helps in receiving digital currency in the crypto wallet. The public key does not include any sensitive information and is visible to everyone on the blockchain. No one can use the public key of your wallet to compromise its security.\n\nThe important component responsible for cryptocurrency security issues is the private key. You can think of it as the password to your crypto wallet. The private key is an automatically generated and lengthy string of characters. You must always maintain privacy of your private key, as anyone can access your wallet and the assets in it with the private key.\n\nExcited to learn the basics of cryptocurrency and the ways in which blockchain technology empowers cryptocurrencies, Enroll now in the Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Course\n\nThe concerns regarding security of crypto wallets round-up on the selection of an ideal crypto wallet. You can find answers to “How secure is a crypto wallet?” by checking the type of the wallet. Some of the most popular crypto wallet variants include hardware wallets, software wallets, paper wallets, and web wallets.\n\nHardware wallets are USB-shaped devices that offer storage of private keys in an offline environment. Therefore, they are the most trusted picks for secure crypto storage. Hardware wallets are the best choice to avoid messages like “crypto wallet hacked” as they are immune to malware. However, hardware wallets have setbacks, such as complex setup processes and limited accessibility.\n\nSoftware wallets are programs that you can use on mobile devices or computers to store and trade cryptocurrencies. While software wallets guarantee convenient and quick transactions, they are vulnerable to malware and hacking attacks.\n\nPaper wallets are physical documents on which you can write your private and public keys. You can trust paper wallets for security against hacking and malware, as you can store paper wallets in secure locations. On the other hand, crypto wallet security for paper wallets is restricted to physical vulnerabilities and a lack of recovery mechanisms. On top of it, retrieving and using your cryptocurrencies can be a challenging task with paper wallets.\n\nWeb wallets or hosted wallets are offered by online platforms and third-party websites. Such types of wallets offer better convenience for faster access to cryptocurrencies and completion of transactions. However, they are limited in terms of security due to the storage of private keys on remote servers.\n\nStart learning about cryptocurrencies with world’s first Cryptocurrency Skill Path with quality resources tailored by industry experts!\n\nThe rising number of cryptocurrency thefts, hacking attacks, and scams has created the need to emphasize wallet security. The emphasis on concerns such as “How secure is a crypto wallet?” can be attributed to the increasing frequency of innovative efforts by criminals to exploit security vulnerabilities. Frequent security attacks can have a significant financial impact on the crypto landscape, which is still in its initial stages. On top of it, security breaches in crypto wallets can also affect the trust of investors and companies in cryptocurrencies.\n\nHackers are working together, especially with the rise of collaborative groups that have criminals with different skill sets. They come up with innovative and sophisticated attack strategies in response to the evolving security measures for crypto wallets. The Federal Trade Commission has reported that cryptocurrency fraud and scams have increased by over 300% every year since 2016. Therefore, it is important to understand the different threats to security of crypto wallets.\n\n\n\nThe best practices recommended for strengthening the security of cryptocurrency wallets emphasize the need to identify common security risks. Here is an outline of the most popular threats to security of crypto wallets.\n\nThe most common type of attacks on crypto wallets are malware attacks. Such types of attacks involve infecting your device with malware or malicious software, such as ransomware, keyloggers, or Trojans. The malware steals information from your device and can access your private keys without your consent. You can prevent such threats through regular updates of your devices and effective antivirus software.\n\nPhishing attack is still one of the prominent cryptocurrency security issues as it is effective and widely used by scammers. Malicious agents try to impersonate legitimate entities and websites to trick users and gain access to sensitive information. Therefore, it is important to verify every unsolicited mail, message, or link and avoid sharing sensitive information.\n\nThe different types of crypto wallets offer unique advantages, albeit with some critical security considerations. Hardware wallets are safe from malware attacks but vulnerable to physical damage. On the other hand, software wallets and mobile wallets are vulnerable to security issues as they are exposed to online environments. You must choose a reliable crypto wallet after comprehensive research to ensure that it meets your security needs.\n\nThe overview of security risks for crypto wallets also invites attention to vulnerabilities in crypto exchanges. You can find your crypto wallet hacked when crypto exchanges are under attack. Security breaches in crypto exchanges have led to loss of customer funds. You should do your research and choose reputed exchanges that feature strong security measures.\n\nWant to get an in-depth understanding of crypto fundamentals, trading and investing strategies?

Here are the important recommendations by experts to protect your crypto wallets from security breaches.\n\nThe most common suggestion for crypto wallet security focuses on using cold wallets or hardware wallets. The hardware wallets are encrypted and connected to the internet, albeit with a limited security risk. You can go for the USB-shaped hardware wallets or use paper wallets to avoid the risks of malware attacks, phishing attacks, and crypto exchange attacks.\n\nHardware wallets or physical wallets can provide better security. However, they lack the ease of use that you get with software wallets. In the case of software wallets, you can use two-factor authentication to introduce an additional layer of security for the wallet. The two-factor authentication method involves the receipt of a one-time code on smartphones. It combines two different levels of access, thereby creating difficulty for hackers.\n\nAnother common suggestion that you must follow to protect your crypto wallets is the use of strong and unique passwords. You can find the perfect answer to “How to secure your crypto wallets” by using a robust password. It is important to create a password with special characters, uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers. The best practices for setting passwords for crypto wallets also advise against using names and birthdays.\n\nYou can find an effective approach to secure crypto wallets by regularly backing up the wallet data. The best thing you can do to secure your crypto wallet is to choose a secure location for your backup. Developers also release updates at different times to address the security vulnerabilities in crypto wallets. Therefore, you must always update your crypto wallet to avoid any unprecedented damage.\n\nThe security of your internet connection also plays a vital role in security of your crypto wallets. You can stay safe from cryptocurrency security issues by avoiding public Wi-Fi, as it could be a breeding ground for security threats. Experts suggest that you can use a VPN to protect the IP address and ensure prevention of DNS leaks.\n\nStart your journey to becoming an expert in Web3 security with the guidance of industry experts with Web3 Security Expert Career Path\n\nThe best practices to safeguard crypto wallets showcase how you can deal with emerging security threats in the crypto landscape. You can achieve success in crypto wallet security by learning about the different security threats to cryptocurrency. The impact of security threats to cryptocurrencies extends beyond the financial impact. Security for crypto wallets can help ensure that users trust crypto wallets and overcome their apprehensions about cryptocurrencies.

    "content": "Are Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors looking for the next big thing? The rise of a new gambling token, Mpeppe (MPEPE), priced at $0.00107, is drawing significant attention from the crypto community. With the potential for explosive growth, many Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders are shifting their focus to this promising new asset.\n\nThe Shiba Inu (SHIB) network value to transactions (NVT) ratio has seen a drastic increase, indicating a possible price correction. According to data from Glassnode, SHIB’s NVT ratio is currently outpacing the meme coin’s price, presenting a bearish outlook. This metric suggests that while SHIB is currently in an uptrend, it may soon face significant resistance on its journey to $0.00003.\n\nIn addition to the NVT ratio, data from IntoTheBlock reveals a reduced correlation between Shiba Inu and Bitcoin. Previously, SHIB had a strong positive correlation with Bitcoin, with a correlation coefficient over 0.9.

    "summary": "Robert Kennedy Jr unveiled an ambitious policy plan that could transform the United States into the world’s largest holder of Bitcoin.\n\n",
    "content": "During the industry day of the annual Bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, Robert Kennedy Jr., an independent candidate for the US presidency, unveiled an ambitious financial policy plan that could transform the United States into the world’s largest holder of Bitcoin. The policy centers on the strategic acquisition of Bitcoin, valued at $619 billion, to match the current US gold reserves. This move, according to Kennedy Jr., is aimed at redefining monetary policy and enhancing fiscal discipline within the federal government.\n\nDuring a roundtable discussion with Scott Melker and Caitlyn Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, Kennedy Jr. emphasized the philosophical alignment between his policies and the Bitcoin community’s ideals of personal freedom, property rights, and governmental integrity. “This is more than about increasing the size of your pile,” Kennedy Jr. said, underlining Bitcoin’s potential to enhance self-sovereignty and counteract what he describes as a “destructive war economy” driven by fiat currency.\n\n“Bitcoin is not only an offramp to this inflationary highway which is the highway to hell, but it also is a way of restoring integrity to our government. It’s a way of restoring personal freedoms, it’s a way the middle class can isolate itself from inflation which is just a form of government theft,” the independent candidate stated.\n\nKennedy Jr. drew a contrast between his consistent advocacy for Bitcoin and the recent supportive gestures from former President Donald Trump, who will speak at the conference on Saturday. Kennedy pointed out Trump’s prior skepticism and his recent controversial decision to potentially appoint JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon as Treasury Secretary, which Kennedy criticized as contrary to the ethos of draining the political “swamp.”\n\nHe added, “President Trump also was connected with Steve Mnuchin who tried to end person-to-person Bitcoin transactions,” emphasizing the need for a cautious approach towards Trump’s newfound enthusiasm for Bitcoin. Moreover, Kennedy Jr. detailed his plan to incrementally integrate Bitcoin into the US treasury. Starting with the issuance of treasury bills anchored to a basket of hard currencies—including platinum and gold—Kennedy proposed a phased approach that would begin with 1% of new treasury issuances backed by these hard assets, scaling up to 100% over time.\n\n“I would be willing to add Bitcoin to the balance sheet. I’m going to do that. I’m gonna actually do a basket of hard currencies of maybe platinum and gold and other hard currencies and begin issuing at least the class of treasury bills that are anchored to hard currency. Let’s say the first year by 1% and then maybe the next year by 2% to watch how that goes because that will inject discipline into the product and ultimately get up to 100%,” Kennedy Jr. explained.\n\nNotably, his strategy would involve direct purchases of Bitcoin to achieve holdings equivalent to the US gold reserves. “I would like to have the federal government begin to buy Bitcoin and over the term my term of office ultimately have an equivalent amount of Bitcoin that we have gold. Because Bitcoin is an honest currency, it’s a currency that’s based upon proof of work,” he declared.\n\nAccording to data by Arkham, the US government currently holds 213,239 BTC worth $14.3 billion confiscated through law enforcement. That means, even if Kennedy would transfer all of these into a strategic reserve, the US would need to buy much more BTC at current prices.\n\nThe US currently holds the largest official gold reserves in the world, with 8,134 tons of gold valued at approximately $619 billion. To match this value with Bitcoin at current prices would require purchasing about 9.4 million BTC. This acquisition would represent nearly 45% of the total 21 million BTC that will ever be mined.\n\nFor perspective, MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, owns 226,331 BTC, and BlackRock, the largest spot Bitcoin ETF manager, controls 334,000 BTC.\n\nAt press time, BTC traded at $66,976.\n\n",

    "summary": "Hyperledger is an open-source umbrella project that offers tools for developing and using blockchain systems and applications across industry sectors.\n\nHyperledger is an open-source community focused on developing a suite of stable frameworks, tools, and libraries for permissioned, enterprise-grade blockchain deployments. It is a global collaboration and includes member organizations that are leaders in finance, banking, Internet of Things, supply chains, manufacturing, and technology. Several sub-projects exist, including Hyperledger Fabric, Cello, Besu, and Caliper.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is Hyperledger?\n\nHyperledger is a global enterprise blockchain project that offers the necessary framework, standards, guidelines, and tools to build open-source blockchains and related applications for use across various industries. Hyperledger\u0027s projects include a variety of enterprise-ready permissioned blockchain platforms and plug-and-play options.\n\nUsing the available components under the Hyperledger umbrella, a business can apply various modular blockchain solutions and services to significantly improve the performance of their operations and the efficiency of their business processes.\n\nHyperledger History\n\nHyperledger is a global collaboration that includes leading businesses from the fields of finance, banking, Internet of Things (IoT), supply chain management, manufacturing and production, and technology. They include big names like Bosch, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Deloitte, Hitachi, American Express, JP Morgan, and Visa, in addition to a host of blockchain-based startups like ConsenSys.\n\nThe Hyperledger project was created in December 2015 by the Linux Foundation, which is based in San Francisco, California. It started with 30 member firms and has grown to about 140 member companies today.\n\nHyperledger was set up with the aim of accelerating industry-wide collaboration to develop high-performance and reliable blockchain and distributed ledger-based technology frameworks. It can be used across various industry sectors to enhance efficiency, performance, and transactions across multiple business processes.\n\nHow Hyperledger Works\n\nConsider Hyperledger to be an operating system that runs on a computer, laptop, other device, or a network, like open-source Linux.\n\nLinux is the underlying programming used to create many operating systems—in fact, it is used much more than other proprietary systems for enterprise purposes. These operating systems can have different designs and user interfaces and be fully customized. Once a Linux operating system is installed (or maybe your device came with it), you can choose what programs you want—maybe you prefer a different internet browser and office suite over the default options.\n\nHyperledger is similar—it is a system that lets the users decide what they want based on their needs. So, a system can be built using one of the existing Hyperledger projects (consider these to be operating systems designed for specific purposes) with different modules for various needs.\n\nHyperledger Projects\n\nSome Hyperledger projects include (but are not limited to) the following:All projects under the Hyperledger umbrella follow the design methodology that supports a modular and extensible approach, interoperability, and security features. The projects remain agnostic to designing tokens or cryptocurrencies, though users can create one as required.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Linux Foundation is home to the Hyperledger open-source collaborative project which aims to provide business-grade blockchain frameworks and technologies. Businesses may build private, permissioned blockchain networks for a variety of use cases. Hyperledger uses include supply chain management and smart contracts, and Hyperledger is known for its modular and adaptable solutions.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "IOTA\u0027s blockless ledger Tangle wants to position itself as a viable alternative to Ethereum\u0027s blockchain.\n\n",
    "content": "The blockchain craze continues unabated as more companies create new applications faster than ever. The architecture made popular by bitcoin and its contemporaries has proven to be a useful tool that offers better security and transparency, leading to its growing adoption in several industries thanks to its effective communications and public ledger.\n\nEven so, blockchain’s meteoric rise has not been without speed bumps, and there have been instances where it has shown weaknesses that could prove to be major challenges down the road.\n\nIn an industry such as the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain’s capabilities have proven to be a particularly strong fit. Interconnected devices require rapid and transparent verification of data, something blockchain’s ledger can handle exceptionally well. However, some have complained that blockchain’s somewhat rigid architecture makes it well-suited for robustly storing small amounts of data. This means it’s not truly scalable for things such as big data storage that has come to be synonymous with IoT.\n\nThis and other concerns led a team of developers to launch IOTA, a cryptocurrency platform designed for the demanding IoT ecosystem. With a twist on the traditional blockchain the company calls Tangle, IOTA claims to provide zero-fee transactions, as well as a unique verification process that resolves many of the scalability problems associated with bitcoin.\n\nTangle is attempting to position itself as a viable alternative to the Ethereum blockchain, which is still the gold standard for most applications built on the architecture. Regardless, new Ethereum-based solutions for IoT could render the discussion moot, offering a better way for IoT to function.\n\nStorage Versus Streaming\n\nOne of the biggest points of contention between supporters of blockchain and Tangle is the former’s capacity for data storage. IoT systems create massive amounts of data to parse and store, and most existing blockchains simply cannot handle the load. Indeed, the technology is meant to offer strong, secure storage for limited amounts of data.\n\nDetractors argue that this philosophy is incompatible with IoT design, and proffer that Tangle delivers a better solution thanks to its take on mining. With IOTA, every transaction requires the user to verify two other, random transactions, creating a tangled ledger that reduces the need for mining and theoretically removes any fees. This makes it a useful infrastructure for IoT devices that require micro and nano-transactions to process data being communicated, without raising overheads.\n\nIn this sense, Tangle architecture does exhibit notable advantages over blockchain. Transaction processing in blockchain means that much larger block sizes and volumes will take significantly longer to process as they must be completely verified to be appended to the chain.\n\nFor an IoT platform, this could represent prohibitive costs, and a lack of functionality due to longer processing times. However, some blockchain-based applications could present a third option using Ethereum’s blockchain, helping to resolve many of the system’s issues with data storage.\n\nStreamr, an application based on Ethereum, has designed a platform for IoT systems that uses live data streaming instead of storage. In the development team’s mind, storage in such technology is superfluous on an atomic level, as most devices require live data to make the best possible decisions, as opposed to outdated information.\n\nMoreover, Streamr proposes to create a marketplace that allows IoT providers to monetize their live data and create a greater incentive for interconnectedness and participation. The system even hosts a development environment designed to facilitate easy creation of IoT applications.\n\nEthereum and Tangle: Which Reigns Supreme?\n\nOn a deeper level, this IoT battle between Streamr and IOTA represents a broader clash of philosophies. On one hand, blockchain has proven to be a game-changing technology. Ethereum’s smart contracts and architecture have lead to a boom in the sector, and the democratization of information.\n\nOn the other hand, Tangle offers to virtually remove the cost of transacting and solve the mining issue thanks to its verification methodology. IOTA also claims that its verification method removes many of the centralization problems traditional mining creates. Because there is no need for miners to process blocks of transactions, there is no motivation to centralize the verification process.\n\nHowever, Ethereum backers have countered that even with Tangle’s supposedly superior design, they must still run on hardware that is not optimized for that type of process. Instead, verification could become bogged down due to existing technology’s binary nature, and lead to longer processing times down the line.\n\nMoreover, solutions like Streamr render the data conversation moot, as they remove the burden of data storage from the blockchain. Instead of handling massive amounts of data that can crash the network, live streamed data offers an immediate solution for IoT, and reduces the overall chain’s operational load. Most importantly, however, is that the existing ecosystem is already geared toward existing platforms such as Ethereum’s ERC-20. By creating applications that fit in to the wider environment, developers can reduce the development costs and compatibility issues.\n\nAn Escalating Race\n\nDespite blockchain’s popularity, new solutions are constantly emerging that could threaten its recent darling status in the technology world. While Ethereum has in many ways solidified its staying power and remains the most popular development environment for blockchain-based applications, Tangle is an intriguing competitor.\n\nIOTA’s architecture is still young, and while it has made promising steps towards broader adoption, the newer upstart must still contend with Ethereum’s existing infrastructure and first-mover advantage. Additionally, companies that build on Ethereum remain ahead, as they are already compatible with the prevailing systems. With the introduction of live-data streaming capabilities from companies like Streamr, Tangle may face an uphill battle dethroning Ethereum in the IoT sphere, even when considering its custom-built design.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Much like the internet, it iss possible to divide the development of blockchain into stages.\n\n",
    "content": "In the development of the internet, one can point to landmark events that can be used to divide the process into stages. Among these important landmarks are the creation of the first wide-area computer networks in the 1960s, the development of an electronic mail system in the 1970s, the creation of ethernet later in that decade, the launching of the world wide web in the 1990s and the creation of the first browsers and search engines later in that decade, among others. Following each of these hallmark developments, the internet changed in a dramatic way. Each step was pivotal in creating the internet that we know and rely on today.\n\nIn a similar way, it\u0027s possible to look back on the development of blockchain and also divide it into stages which are marked off by important developments and inventions. Blockchain technology has only been in existence for a fraction of the time that the internet has, so it\u0027s likely that there are still important developments to come. Even now, though, experts have begun to divide the history of blockchain into at least three important stages.\n\nStage 1: Bitcoin and Digital Currencies\n\nWhile the ideas that would go into the blockchain were swirling around in computer science communities, it was the pseudonymous developer of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, who outlined the blockchain as we know it in the white paper for BTC. In this way, blockchain technology began with the Bitcoin network. While blockchain has since gone on to see use in a huge variety of other areas, in some sense it was designed specially for this digital currency and for advancing the goals of digital currencies more broadly.\n\nIn the earliest stages, blockchain set up the basic premise of a shared public ledger that supports a cryptocurrency network. Satoshi\u0027s idea of blockchain makes use of 1 megabyte (MB) blocks of information on bitcoin transactions. Blocks are linked together through a complex cryptographic verification process, forming an immutable chain. Even in its earliest guises, blockchain technology set up many of the central features of these systems, which remain today. Indeed, bitcoin\u0027s blockchain remains largely unchanged from these earliest efforts.\n\nStage 2: Smart Contracts\n\nAs time went on, developers began to believe that a blockchain could do more than simply document transactions. Founders of ethereum, for instance, had the idea that assets and trust agreements could also benefit from blockchain management. In this way, ethereum represents the second-generation of the blockchain technology.\n\nThe major innovation brought about by ethereum was the advent of smart contracts. Typically, contracts in the mainstream business world are managed between two separate entities, sometimes with other entities assisting in the oversight process. Smart contracts are those that are self-managing on a blockchain. They are triggered by an event like the passing of an expiration date or the achievement of a particular price goal; in response, the smart contract manages itself, making adjustments as needed and without the input of outside entities.\n\nAt this point, we may still be in the process of harnessing the untapped potential of smart contracts. Thus, whether we have truly moved on to the subsequent stage of the development of blockchain is debatable.\n\nStage 3: The Future\n\nOne of the major issues facing blockchain is scaling. Bitcoin remains troubled by transaction processing times and bottlenecking. Many new digital currencies have attempted to revise their blockchains in order to accommodate these issues, but with varying degrees of success. In the future, one of the most important developments paving the way for blockchain technology going forward will likely have to do with scalability.\n\nBeyond this, new applications of blockchain technology are being discovered and implemented all the time. It\u0027s difficult to say exactly where these developments will lead the technology and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. Supporters of blockchain are likely to find this incredibly exciting; from their perspective, we are living in a moment with an epochal technology that is continuing to grow and unfold.\n\n",

    "summary": "From ideation and fundraising to launch, explore these resources and learn everything you need to know to launch a Web3 startup.\n\n",
    "content": "Launching a Web3 startup can be a daunting task. Compared to their Web2 counterparts, Web3 founders lack access to the abundance of knowledge and resources that come with an established sector. But given the nascent nature of the Web3 industry, there’s immense opportunity and an open frontier of ideas for founders to build and find success with. This is the Web3 startup tradeoff—building a standout Web3 startup requires that founders venture into previously unexplored territories that only a select few have successfully navigated. There is more opportunity and fresh ground to explore, but less guidance on offer as a result.\n\nHowever, there are still some resources for founders to draw from, plus the examples of those who have gone before. This post provides founders with the most recent information, guidance, and resources on how to effectively launch, fund, grow, and scale a Web3 startup.\n\nWeb3 products are often software products, meaning founders can leverage the same lean-startup model that has proven successful in Web2 technology companies. The core of this model can be broken down into three iterative processes—build, measure, and learn. By following these steps, startups can minimize the time and effort spent on product development to quickly find product-market fit.\n\nDiscover how to effectively gauge demand and build Web3 products that users actually want by reading this blog.\n\nBut what does it mean to actually achieve product-market fit, and how do you measure it? This article dives into the theory behind finding product-market fit and provides time-tested conceptual frameworks for Web3 startups to understand the type of market they’re in, whether they’ve achieved product-market fit and how to measure it, and what to do next.\n\nRaising funds is one of the toughest but most important challenges for a Web3 startup that’s just getting off the ground. How much to raise, where to look for funds, what investors are looking for, and how to effectively showcase your startup’s potential are all important questions that Web3 founders should be asking—and the answers depend on the specific vertical, the stage of the startup, and more.\n\nThe good news is that Web3 startups have more fundraising opportunities than ever before, from blockchain grants and crowdfunding options to traditional VC investment. This introductory post provides the context you need to set yourself up for fundraising success and put yourself in the shoes of an investor.\n\nOnce you’ve read the article above, browse through this curated list of Web3 fundraising resources to understand the options that are out there for Web3 startups and choose the ones that are best for your startup’s goals.\n\nMarketing tactics are continuously evolving in Web3 as startups find new ways to attract and retain users. Given their community focus and decentralized nature, Web3 startups often deploy marketing strategies that can’t be replicated by their Web2 counterparts. However, founders must carefully consider the tactics that best suit their startup.\n\nDive deep into the landscape of Web3 marketing and explore the many strategies, tactics, tools, and metrics that startups must consider when creating a robust marketing framework that can quickly adapt to changing conditions.\n\nWho are your startup’s customers? In this regard, marketing and product development go hand in hand. When considering the very early stages of a Web3 startup’s go-to-market strategy, it’s important to nail down the key elements needed for a successful launch. This depends entirely on a startup’s desired community.\n\nThis article breaks down Web3 opportunities into different verticals and analyzes the go-to-market strategies of successful Web3 projects in order to provide founders with a clear understanding of how and why Web3 marketing is different.\n\nBuilding communities of developers is mission-critical to protocol success. They form the backbone of a project’s ecosystem and can be called upon to build additional utility that your team might not have the time or resources for.\n\nEven if your project doesn’t need a developer community, the tactics and theoretical frameworks mentioned in this blog post will be handy for any Web3 startup that wants to build a robust community of any kind.\n\nLaunching a Web3 startup is not an easy endeavor, but it can pay dividends for those that build standout products and have a clear plan to scale.\n\nDon’t attempt to memorize all of the frameworks, strategies, and tactics mentioned in this article. Instead, choose the domain that’s most relevant to your current challenge and refer back to this post when you need guidance on specific topics, like product development or fundraising. Ultimately, no guide or resource can provide you with an impenetrable blueprint for success. Building a startup is, and likely always will be, more of an art than a science—these resources simply give you a canvas to start drawing on.\n\n",

    "content": "A move to create a new yield-bearing protocol called goldCOMP by a large group of COMP holders, the native token of the Compoud lending protocol, has been called off, and the market is reacting positively.\n\nCOMP added 5.6% to $51.27 after the proposal\u0027s backers, a whale named Humpy and a group of COMP holders known as the Golden Boys, agreed to cancel their proposal and vote for an alternative that involves creating a staking product that will be controlled by the CompoundDAO decentralized autonomous organization.\n\nThe goldCOMP proposal, which critics are calling a governance attack, involved coordinated efforts to push a resolution through the DAO to allocate $24 million in COMP tokens to create a yield-bearing protocol intended to provide passive income. It was unpopular with many large stakeholders in the Compound ecosystem, including Wintermute, owing to allegations of vote manipulation by the proposers, concerns about the centralization of control and potential risks of mismanaging the $24 million COMP treasury funds.\n\nNow, the crisis has been averted.\n\nInstead, Humpy and the collective have agreed to a counter-proposal that will create a staking product that distributes 30% of existing and new market reserves annually to staked COMP holders, proportional to their stake.\n\nThe new staked product will be controlled by the Compound DAO – directly addressing a concern many had that Humpy and the Golden Boys would have outsized control – and will be audited by a designated security partner appointed by Compound and continually audited by the DAO\u0027s Market Risk Manager.\n\nThis is all contingent on Humpy formally withdrawing Proposal 289, which passed, that allocated COMP tokens into a trust to create goldCOMP. Humpy did not withdraw the offer by the initial deadline, but said in forum posts that he \"fully approves\" the idea.\n\n",

    "content": "Australia\u0027s regulators have provided rare updates on their plans for the digital assets sector, including plans to introduce a draft framework for stablecoins and hinted that more enforcement is on its way against unlicensed entities during an event in Sydney on Wednesday.\n\nThe event, Digital Assets: Anchoring the Digital Economy, was hosted by Blockchain Australia, the nation\u0027s policy body for the industry.\n\nAustralia\u0027s Treasury previously announced plans to release draft legislation to cover licensing and custody rules for crypto asset providers by the end of 2024. Now, that draft could include a framework to regulate stablecoins.\n\n\"The digital asset platform reforms have been allocated a drafting spot with The Office of Parliamentary Counsel (responsible for drafting and publishing Australian laws) that would see the exposure draft released before the end of this year,\" said Chris Adamek, director of the Australian Treasury\u0027s digital asset policy unit.\n\n\"Within that drafting slot, there are various reforms and each has a different priority to the payments reforms, which would include our proposed framework for regulating stablecoins sit within that same slot, and they\u0027ll be sort of done one after the other. Given that overlap, reps (representatives) are hoping that both of them will be released at the same time.\"\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said it was assisting the government in providing advice to colleagues in the Treasury and that it was having regular meetings with peers across the world including the EU, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and North America to understand more about the cases they have filed against digital asset firms.\n\n\"We are actively monitoring cases overseas and interacting regularly with our overseas peers,\" said Dr Rhys Bollen, senior executive leader of digital assets at ASIC. \"We had an hour on the phone with the SEC this morning talking about some of the work that they\u0027re doing and what we can learn from that. We have run half a dozen (cases) already that interact with the digital assets and crypto assets base and we do have more.\"\n\nAdditionally, ASIC\u0027s representative said it has and will provide guidance but it is also subject to the law, warning crypto entities to fall in line with the precedents set in the recent cases it has filed against crypto entities in front of an audience of industry goers.\n\n\"When did you last review the tokens that you list on your platform? When was the last time you reviewed the products and services that you are making available? How recently have you consulted with your lawyers about where the law currently sees the most current understanding based on cases over the last six months or so. If you haven\u0027t done that in the last four months you need to consider where you are,\" Bollen said.\n\nBollen also said ASIC would be appealing recent judgements that, at least in part, were in favor of crypto entities such as Block Earner and BPS Financial Pty Ltd (BPS). In recent times, ASIC has sued Binance Australia and social investing platform eToro, while major banks of the nation have imposed partial restrictions on crypto citing scams.\n\nBlockchain Australia has now rebranded to become the Digital Economy Council of Australia (DECA) and will include a membership category for banks.\n\nRead More: Australia\u0027s First Spot Bitcoin ETF With Direct BTC Holdings to Go Live on Tuesday\n\n",

    "content": "In a significant development showcasing the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies within traditional financial systems, the Jersey City pension fund is in the process of allocating an undisclosed percentage of its assets to invest in Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAccording to Jersey Mayor Steven Fulop, the city’s pension fund is currently updating its paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow allocations to Bitcoin ETFs, mirroring a similar move by the Wisconsin Pension Fund earlier this year.\n\nHowever, the percentage of the fund’s allocation to Bitcoin ETFs remains undisclosed, pending final approval from the SEC, but is expected to be completed by the end of the summer.\n\nThe issuer selected by the city’s fund to manage its investment was also not disclosed in Fulop’s announcement on Thursday. The Jersey City mayor also took to social media to comment on BTC and the crypto industry stating:\n\nNot my normal subject matter in a post but I’ll share anyway – the question on whether Crypto/Bitcoin is here to stay is largely over + crypto/Bitcoin won.\n\nMayor Fulop, a self-described long-time believer in crypto, noted that beyond just cryptocurrencies, he believes blockchain technology is “amongst the most important new technology innovations since the internet.”\n\nAs our sister site Bitcoinist reported back in May, the Wisconsin State Investment Board allocated about $98.6 million, or 2% of its fund, to one of the most successful Bitcoin ETFs and asset managers, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nFollowing the recent approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC on Monday, asset managers are reportedly quickly ramping up efforts to launch a range of new crypto-based investment products.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, industry giants like ProShares have already filed paperwork for six funds that would provide long and short exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Meanwhile, issuers like Hashdex are looking to package the two largest cryptocurrencies into a single investment vehicle.\n\nThe rush of new product filings comes on the heels of the successful debuts of the first Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US in January and Tuesday, respectively, as they have collectively attracted more than $17.5 billion in net inflows so far in 2024, dwarfing the flows of some major tech-focused ETFs. Athanasios Psarofagis, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said:\n\nThe successful launches of the first crypto ETFs this year took many analysts by surprise, as the funds attracted significantly more assets than expected. This is clearly emboldening issuers to get even more creative in their efforts to capitalize on surging investor demand.\n\nAt the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has tumbled over the past few hours and retreated to the $64,990 level, representing a 2.3% drop compared to Wednesday’s trading price.\n\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com\n\n",

    "content": "Blockchain is emerging as a powerful technological force that promises to change the travel industry’s status quo. In fact, it\u0027s already being heralded as a game-changer for many different industries. Remember that blockchain is a type of database that is commonly used in the cryptocurrency market wherein data is stored in blocks and then chained together.\n\nServices that are based on blockchain are already isolating major pain points in a very fragmented industry—travel and tourism. It should come as no surprise that this sector is broken up into different parts. Think flights, hotels, car rentals, among other factors. So how can blockchain help? These services are able to ease hurdles in the industry by resolving common challenges and streamlining processes while building a more equitable ecosystem that shuns gatekeepers.\n\nThe technology’s impact is more than hypothetical, though, with several businesses disrupting several nodes on the industry’s supply chain. The following five companies are improving key aspects of the travel ecosystem and establishing blockchain’s place in the industry.\n\n1. Winding Tree: Displacing Online Booking Hubs\n\nMajor travel service aggregators like Expedia and Priceline dominate airfare bookings. But this comes at a serious cost to both travelers and airlines. Booking through these websites often includes hefty fees and surcharges made possible by their largely unchallenged status as gatekeepers. Blockchain-based startup Winding Tree works to unseat these entrenched giants by challenging their role as industry middlemen.\n\nWinding Tree is a private company based in Switzerland. Founded in 2017, it reaches numerous parts of the travel and tourism industry, including hotels and airfare. The company uses \"blockchain technology to enable a fair and competitive travel distribution market.\"The company seeks to connect travelers directly with service providers like airlines, hotels, and tour guides with its LÍF token. The aim is to minimize fees for travelers while reducing costs for service providers. LÍF is Winding Tree\u0027s platform cryptocurrency.\n\nThe company’s clever use of smart contracts and the ERC827 protocol delivers better savings for every stakeholder in the travel and tourism industry. Winding Tree\u0027s nonprofit status assures there are no middlemen adding unnecessary fees to the booking process.\n\n2. Webjet: Adding Assurances and Avoiding Inaccuracies\n\nInaccurate or lost hotel bookings add considerable stress and anxiety to a travel experience. When this happens, customers usually have to take on fees across several layers of the supply chain while providers consistently extract value.\n\nThanks to blockchain’s immutable distributed ledger technology, Webjet has built a new model designed to avoid these irritating booking experiences. The company is a prominent online travel agency based in Australia and was founded in 1998. Webjet claims that it is Australia and New Zealand\u0027s leading online agency and is a leader in online tools and technology.\n\nWebjet officially launched its blockchain platform in 2019. The system enhances the customer experience by recording all entries on the blockchain’s immutable ledger, which reduces the likelihood of mistaken or lost bookings and reduces the layers between sellers and consumers. It does this by locating real-time data problems that may occur between customers, agents, and hotels and sending messages to every party.\n\nThe technology’s improved security features provide better protection for the ecosystem. Apart from building greater supply chain efficiencies and reducing costs for hotels, travelers ultimately benefit from lower-cost bookings along with more transparency and greater accountability.\n\n3. Sandblock: Improving Loyalty’s Fungibility\n\nLoyalty rewards have gone through several iterations in the competitive travel and tourism industry. Many frequent travelers belong to airline and hotel loyalty programs. Spending points and miles often means jumping through multiple hoops to redeem rewards. Despite high participation rates in loyalty programs, many customers report a willingness to accept better deals from competing carriers and service providers if the price is right.\n\nSandblock is one of the newest entrants to this part of the industry. Founded in 2017, Sandblock is based in France. It aims to change the loyalty landscape with its blockchain-based platform by allowing travel providers to create their own loyalty tokens, which can be exchanged for brand-specific rewards. Not only that but they can also be used like real coins and exchanged for fiat money.\n\nUsers can also apply their tokens to redeem rewards across a variety of services beyond the company that awarded them and can earn more by being active participants in the community. For businesses, the reward is better data and transparency, and an ecosystem that actually returns value thanks to improved targeting and happier consumers.\n\n4. Accenture: Striving Towards Shorter Lines\n\nSpending hours waiting in lines at airports is one of the major annoyances of traveling the globe not just for travelers but also for airlines and airport staff. Congestion can add to the time spent in lines for security, customs, and passport control. Security needs are also trumpeted as the reason for tighter controls and oversight, all of which contribute to frequent travelers\u0027 headaches.\n\nTo overcome these challenges and expedite the security process, Accenture (ACN) developed the Known Traveler Digital Identity System. The consulting firm partnered with the World Economic Forum (WEF) to help disrupt the global travel industry.\n\nThis blockchain is designed to collect and host identifying information from frequent international travelers, enabling a freer flow of data between travelers and customs agents to ease the clearance process.\n\nThis allows travelers to gain control over their digital identities with better security thanks to distributed ledger technology. Airports and airlines benefit from accelerated processing and better security, helping shorten lines all while alleviating one of the biggest traveler pain points.\n\n5. TravelChain: Making the Most of Data\n\nData is a prized commodity in today’s economy. It offers businesses insights and advantages when used appropriately. Data generated by travelers, which is highly valuable to service providers, is generally restricted to gatekeepers such as Expedia and Orbitz. These companies offer a faster booking process at a price. This raises costs and adds to the informational asymmetry for service providers.\n\nTravelChain is a new entrant that wants to upend the paradigm with an open-source blockchain. The Russian company seeks to remove intermediaries on the supply chain. Users are empowered to collect and monetize their travel data, keeping it safe from prying eyes and receiving tokens as compensation for sharing with travel service providers. These tokens can then be redeemed for services or money.\n\nParticipating companies can access more granular information about travelers, channeling these insights for more pinpointed promotion targeting. Apart from personalizing marketing, these companies can offer customized tours and promotions based on a traveler’s preferences, closing the entire ecosystem loop and delivering value to all stakeholders.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTraveling should be comfortable, cost-effective, and most importantly, enjoyable. While fees, booking irregularities, bad reviews, and long lines may be symptomatic of the current travel environment, blockchain is challenging this status quo with a host of new services designed to modernize and streamline the travel experience.\n\nThanks to the formation of more equitable ecosystems constructed to reduce the presence of intermediaries, travelers and service providers can build more mutually fulfilling relationships that contribute to better overall value.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

    "summary": "The emergence of cryptocurrencies has spawned new investment potential. Some of these might be odd, but where there is value, there is opportunity.\n\nMany established tech companies are investing heavily in blockchain and distributed ledger technology applications. Cryptocurrencies are part of blockchain technology designed for transferring value; investors are also using them to store value, hedge other investments, and hold them for growth. Non-fungible tokens are part of the emerging metaverse design as ownership of digital assets becomes popular. Digital securities use blockchain to create traditional investments such as stocks and bonds. Web 3 is a concept of internet privacy and ownership being developed using blockchain technology.\n\nParamount among the benefits of DLT is its ability to reduce the costs of maintaining, securing, and verifying databases on a global scale.\n\nNew blockchain uses are constantly emerging as more companies research ways to incorporate it into their industries and internal procedures.\n\nDigital securities trading may not be regulated or available where you live, so ensure you check with your country\u0027s authorities before attempting it.\n\n",
    "content": "Distributed ledger technology (DLT) and blockchain have made their way into business, finance, and many other industries. Their introduction to the mainstream following the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies has created new investment vehicles, opportunities, and new sectors. Additionally, new business models using these advancements are emerging that improve workflows, data security, e-commerce, government processes, and much more.\n\nA distributed ledger is a network of stored files in which every transaction is recorded. Blockchain was developed from the distributed ledger concept, but it enhances public use and security. Programs are used to confirm, validate, and archive information, and they can be accessed in near real-time by all participants.\n\nIn general, there are four broad areas for you to consider investing in: cryptocurrency itself, investment instruments linked to or holding cryptocurrency, non-fungible tokens, and businesses developing and implementing new products that use blockchain or distributed ledger technology.\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain\n\nBlockchain technology is similar to distributed ledger technology (DLT) but is specific to cryptocurrency and the ecosystems that have evolved from it. It uses encryption and verification methods to restrict access to append-only, where new data can be entered, but existing data can not be changed.\n\nBlockchain use cases have exploded, with the technology making its way into everything from tokenizing pixel art to fantasy football leagues to digital worlds where you can buy virtual real estate.\n\nUnderstanding Distributed Ledger Technology\n\nDLT is used across enterprises to synchronize and share data in a ledger while verifying the accuracy of inputs and outputs. The span of industries using DLT continues to grow, encompassing supply chains, accounting, financial services, warehousing, shipping, and more.\n\nThe good news is that opportunities for investing in blockchain and DLT are abundant, giving you a chance to leverage the potential offered. How you choose to invest in blockchain technology will largely depend on the amount of risk you\u0027re willing to incur and what interests you.\n\nCompanies Developing Blockchain Uses\n\nYou can invest in several companies that are researching and developing blockchain and DLT products and services. Many well-known companies are developing blockchains for business, and many more are creating them for in-house use. There are several markets you can choose from:Decentralized finance (DeFi) is the concept of removing financial institutions from their role as third parties in transactions. The idea is to allow people to take control of their finances with digital wallets, peer-to-peer lending, and other financial services.\n\nWhile cryptocurrency is part of DeFi, it is only the tip of the iceberg. DeFi is the all-inclusive term for all things financial that are not part of any traditional, centralized method of controlling money. Cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency exchanges, lenders, borrowers, and even insurance are part of this growing sector.\n\nFinancial technology (Fintech) is the development and use of technology to improve existing financial services. The developments in blockchain technology are revolutionizing traditional services like lending, money transfers, and banking. Paypal is one of the most well-known examples of a fintech company—there are many more you can choose from to diversify your portfolio.\n\nThe metaverse is one of the more difficult concepts to grasp that is expected to use blockchain. The metaverse is an emerging digital and ever-present world where virtual reality, augmented reality, and reality meet. The concept is to develop an immersive digital experience where a person can learn, work, play, and socialize.\n\nSocial media platforms, game developers, and technology companies are developing the hardware and software needed for this digital life experience. Meta (formerly Facebook), Advanced Microdevices (AMD), Nvidia, Amazon, and Epic Games are examples of companies that have expressed interest in metaverse products and services. Blockchain will play a large part in the metaverse as it develops.\n\nWeb 3 companies are developing solutions that are reportedly set to change how the Internet works in the background. Blockchain technology is being used to create an infrastructure designed to restore privacy, ownership, and control to the masses.\n\nHere are some of the emerging theories on how Web 3 will benefit everyone using blockchain technology:You can trade or invest in cryptocurrencies by setting up an account on a cryptocurrency exchange. Price movements create opportunities for profits through day trading or buying and selling cryptocurrencies.\n\nThese exchanges are also businesses—Coinbase (COIN) is a publicly traded company with stocks listed on the Nasdaq exchange that can expose you to blockchain without requiring you to invest directly in cryptocurrency.\n\nDigital Securities\n\nBlockchain has enabled the decentralization and tokenization of nearly anything that has value. For example, a company that wants to raise money can create digital investment instruments using a blockchain, similar to how non-fungible tokens are created. Tokenization, in this respect, is the transfer of ownership or interest to a token, which is the digital representation of that ownership linked to the blockchain.\n\nDigital securities use smart contracts—programs that execute exchanges or trades as soon as both parties agree to it. This creates a safety net for traders and investors who want to buy or sell securities directly with another party rather than through a transaction facilitator like a broker.\n\nThe digital securities market continues to evolve, but you can find them emerging in sectors such as:The main benefit of digital securities is that they can be fractionalized to a much greater degree than is practical with traditional securities. In addition, this fractionalization offers exposure to markets that you may not have previously been able to access due to the amount of capital needed to gain entry.\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that are tokenized. They existed before 2021, but media attention that year popularized them in the mainstream after the digital artist Beeple sold a collage of non-fungible tokens for $69 million. An NFT can be any digital asset—clothing, art, music, movies, video games, or anything else that can be tokenized.\n\nEmerging and Future Developments\n\nFollowing Bitcoin\u0027s release, the products that have emerged using blockchains have been at the center of most people\u0027s interest. There isn\u0027t much left to tokenize that hasn\u0027t already been attempted, and new cryptocurrencies do not gain much attention because they are just more of what is already available. Decentralized applications and decentralized financial services are more common.\n\nBlockchain developers continue to work on scaling issues, transaction throughput, centralization concerns, and more—with new blockchains emerging all the time. But similar to the cryptocurrencies created using blockchains, more blockchains are just more of the same.\n\nWeb 3 development is underway, but whether it will gain traction is unclear. There is still a long road ahead and developers face many challenges—primarily convincing those who have monetized the web\u0027s infrastructure to release their interests in favor of allowing the dream of decentralization to be realized.\n\nBlockchain development, as the average person understands it (the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies, decentralized applications, technology behind Web 3) is expected to continue growing, but it\u0027s possible that it will slow in favor of newer technology.\n\nIf the Blockchain Boom Stalls, What\u0027s Next?\n\nBlockchain brought about the realization that data and information can be immutable and accurate. Next came developments in artificial intelligence, which progressed as rapidly as blockchain did after Bitcoin was popularized.\n\nLatest developments point to a merger of three technologies—immutable and accurate data, smart contracts, and artificial intelligence. The theory is that, eventually, this merger will bring authenticity to data, augment businesses with vast amounts of internal and external data, automate many costly processes, and reduce the time needed in decision-making by providing accurate and data-backed recommendations.\n\nFor businesses, this translates into reduced costs and streamlined operations. For investors, it means companies that invest in incorporating blockchain and AI solutions are likely to be more accurate in reporting, more profitable, and more trustworthy.\n\nTo remain competitive, businesses are going to need blockchains backing them because they create trust and can automate many processes. Artificial intelligence can analyze vast amounts of data and facilitate decision-making or even initiate smart contract execution, speeding up processes tremendously.\n\nSmall businesses won\u0027t be able to keep up, so they will need to determine if they could benefit from blockchain+AI-as-a-service solutions, another emerging service.\n\nQuite possibly, the next iteration of blockchain development will be an industry that combines all blockchain and AI developments. This industry is expected by some to grow exponentially in the near future.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrency and is where most development and research are focused. It is becoming more popular as more use cases are conceived and people learn more about it.\n\n",

    "content": "Digital technologies such as Deep Learning and Machine Learning have taken the world by storm. Although these technologies are in their nascent stage, they have shown immense potential. The emergence of these technological concepts is a boon for individuals and businesses alike. Today, it has become a necessity to gain insight into the technologies that are revolutionizing our lives.\n\nHowever, if you want to understand these technologies at a comprehensive level, you need to familiarize yourself with not only the unique concepts but also the differences that exist between them. For someone who wants to have a promising career in the competitive IT industry, it is essential to know how concepts such as DL and ML are influencing the trajectory of AI. Before understanding the deep learning vs machine learning difference, it is essential to have a clear knowledge of the respective technological concepts.\n\n\n\nMachine Learning (ML) is a subdomain of Artificial Intelligence technology. ML primarily focuses on the creation of algorithms and statistical models that allow computer systems to learn. Thanks to ML, computers can make decisions or predictions without the need to explicitly program them.\n\nThus, Machine Learning involves training algorithms to support the identification of relationships and patterns. Ultimately, such patterns help make predictions about new data. In simple words, ML is the type of Artificial Intelligence that relies on minimum human interference.\n\nSome of the chief features of Machine Learning are:\n\nTake your first step towards learning about artificial intelligence through AI Flashcards\n\nDeep Learning is a part of Machine Learning. It makes use of neural networks with diverse layers to analyze complex associations and patterns in data. It is capable of mimicking the human brain to carry out a broad range of tasks, such as speech recognition as well as natural language processing. One of the main highlights of Deep Learning models is that they are capable of learning. Hence, they can improve over time, and their level of accuracy can improve as they process data.\n\nSome of the chief features of Deep Learning are:\n\nAlthough to a layman, the terms Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning may sound similar. The reality is that each of these concepts is different from one another. However, they are related to each other. Now that you have clarity on deep learning and machine learning concepts, it is time to answer the following question: What are the differences between deep learning and machine learning?\n\nExcited to learn the fundamentals of AI applications in business? Enroll now in the AI For Business Course\n\nThere exist a number of deep learning vs machine learning differences. By identifying how the technological concepts are unique, it is possible to identify their true potential.\n\nMachine Learning is the branch of Artificial Intelligence. Since it is trained on statistical models and algorithms, it is capable of making predictions. The technology relies on historical data as well as training to strengthen its capabilities. A key thing to bear in mind is that ML relies on human intervention so that data can be fed and improvements can be made.\n\nDeep Learning can be defined as the subset of Machine Learning technology. It is a model that can help an algorithm ascertain whether a prediction is accurate or not. The role of neural networks is indispensable in Deep Learning. As neural networks empower software to comprehend complex patterns, there is no need for human intervention.\n\nThe difference between machine learning and deep learning arises from the use of data representation. In the case of machine learning, the data representation that is used is quite different from that of deep learning. In Machine Learning, structured data is used. This type of data is highly valuable since it can be searched and analyzed in a simple and efficient manner. ML techniques may find it challenging to work on unstructured data. This is due to the fact that the training dataset may have infinite variations.\n\nThe data representation that is used in Deep Learning is different as it involves neural networks. DL is capable of working with not only structured data but also with unstructured data. The technology can be used for a broad range of unstructured data such as images, audio, text as well as tables containing data.\n\nThe values that are arranged in structures are known as data points. Machine Learning encompasses thousands of data points, whereas Deep Learning involves millions of data points. This feature goes on to show that Machine Learning is capable of working well with relatively small databases. On the other hand, Deep Learning relies on a humongous volume of data while carrying out its task. DL basically requires large amounts of data so that it can understand and perform tasks better than conventional ML algorithms.\n\n\n\nWhile exploring deep learning vs machine learning, a key difference that arises is related to the training time. Training time is basically the time that is taken by a model for the purpose of training on a dataset. When it comes to ML algorithms, they require less time for training. The training time may range between a few seconds to a number of hours. However, the same is not the case when it comes to Deep Learning. The training time for a Deep Learning neural network may span between a few hours to several weeks. However, it may be possible to adopt certain methods to hasten the training time.\n\nWhen it comes to Machine Learning, it may be possible to set up and run the system in no time. However, although it may be easy to set up the system, it does not mean that its effectiveness is guaranteed. In fact, the effectiveness of the system may be hampered. On the contrary, setting up Deep Learning may seem time-consuming, but there is no compromise on the effectiveness of the system. Once the system is up and running, there is a need for limited or no intervention. It is capable of generating results in an effective manner. Moreover, the quality of the outcome is likely to get better with the passage of time.\n\nThe resources that are required for ML systems and DL systems may vary considerably. It is possible to execute Machine Learning on simple and standard computer systems. As ML does not require a large volume of computational power, it can be supported by a standard computer. However, the same cannot be said about deep Learning.\n\nDeep Learning systems require powerful hardware and software resources so that they can function properly. As DL involves a broad number of operations, it needs a robust system that can support it. In the absence of appropriate resources, the efficiency and functionality of DL may be diminished.\n\nWant to understand the importance of ethics in AI, ethical frameworks, principles, and challenges? Enroll now in the Ethics Of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Course\n\nWhen it comes to deep learning vs machine learning, a key difference is related to the featurization process. In machine learning, it is essential for users to identify and create features accurately. It shows that the technology relies on users to carry out its tasks and functions. However, in the case of deep learning technology, there is no need for users to intervene. DL is capable of learning high-level features from the data itself. That’s not all! Deep Learning can create new features all by itself without relying on the help and support of humans.\n\nThe table below presents a comparison between Deep Learning and Machine Learning.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the technology-driven era, the future of Machine Learning and Deep Learning is full of promise and potential. The unique features and capabilities of these technologies make them highly capable of carrying out a broad range of tasks and operations. As AI technology is reaching new heights, the future of both ML and DL is extremely bright.\n\nIf you wish to make your career in the dynamic IT domain, it is a must to broaden your knowledge about AI, ML, and DL. Currently, these technologies are serving as catalysts and influencing the trajectory of the IT industry. The emergence of technologies such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning have given rise to new job opportunities. If you are passionate about establishing yourself as a competent IT professional, you need to brush up on your skills relating to ML and DL.\n\nIdentify new ways to leverage the full potential of generative AI in business use cases and become an expert in generative AI technologies with Generative AI Skill Path\n\nIn the Artificial Intelligence landscape, technologies such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning play a key role. The key differences between ML and DL have been presented. The technologies give a glimpse into the power of modern technologies. There exist a number of deep learning vs machine learning differences relating to the underlying concepts, data representation, use of data points, training time, effectiveness, and setting up time resource requirements and featurization processes.\n\nToday, both machine learning and deep learning are revolutionary technologies. The emergence of these technologies has been of immense value. The future of these technological concepts is full of high potential. These modern technologies have given rise to new opportunities and possibilities in the vast IT industry.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to rapid shifts and dynamic trends. Recently, the launch of multiple Ethereum (ETH) ETFs in the US marked a significant milestone. However, despite the promising debut of these ETFs, Ethereum’s price has experienced a decline. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE), a rising star in the meme coin space, is poised for a substantial rally. This article explores the impacts of Ethereum ETFs on its performance and the potential gains for Mpeppe investors.\n\nOn July 22, 2024, nine Ethereum (ETH) ETFs were launched in the United States, generating significant attention and trading volume. On their first day, these ETFs recorded a combined trading volume of $1.1 billion, signaling strong investor interest. However, despite this robust start, the price of Ethereum fell by over 6% in the following week. This decline can be attributed to substantial outflows from existing funds like the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which heavily influenced market sentiment.\n\nThe launch of the Ethereum (ETH) ETFs saw varied reactions across different trading platforms. On exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, there was a noticeable increase in buying activity. In contrast, platforms such as OKX and Bullish experienced a surge in sales, indicating that some traders were taking profits. This mixed trading activity contributed to the overall market volatility and the subsequent drop in Ethereum’s price.\n\nFinancial news outlets highlight Solana’s impressive performance relative to Ethereum (ETH). On the day of reporting, Solana achieved sales of $1.07 million, more than double Ethereum’s $0.55 million. However, when examining longer timeframes, Ethereum still leads, with monthly sales reaching $52.34 million compared to Solana’s $23.24 million.\n\nDespite the challenges faced by Ethereum (ETH), including significant outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, the cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects remain strong. Bullish comments from notable figures like Donald Trump at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville have contributed to a more positive outlook for Ethereum (ETH). However, the market’s response to these developments will be crucial in determining the cryptocurrency’s trajectory.\n\nWhile Ethereum (ETH) navigates its market dynamics, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly gaining traction. Currently in Stage 2 of its presale, Mpeppe is priced at $0.00107 USDT, with nearly 60% of the tokens already sold. This rapid progress reflects growing investor confidence and enthusiasm for Mpeppe’s potential.\n\nMpeppe (MPEPE) distinguishes itself with innovative features, particularly its integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming platforms. These features provide real utility and tangible value to its users, setting Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart from other meme coins that rely primarily on hype.\n\nMuch like Ethereum (ETH), Mpeppe (MPEPE) benefits from a robust and active community. Social media promotions and community discussions have significantly boosted Mpeppe’s popularity, driving investor interest and participation in its presale.\n\nAnalysts predict that early investments in Mpeppe (MPEPE) could see a substantial return, potentially as high as 600%. This optimistic outlook is driven by the coin’s innovative approach, strong community backing, and the rapid progress of its presale.\n\nThe introduction of Ethereum (ETH) ETFs has had a mixed impact on its market performance, leading to significant price fluctuations. However, the long-term prospects for Ethereum (ETH) remain strong, bolstered by increasing investor interest and positive market sentiment. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a compelling opportunity for investors seeking high returns. With its innovative features, strong community support, and promising presale progress, Mpeppe is well-positioned for a substantial rally.\n\nFor those looking to invest in Mpeppe (MPEPE), the smart contract address is 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, strategic investments in promising assets like Mpeppe could yield significant rewards.\n\n\n\nFor more information on the Mpeppe (MPEPE) Presale:\n\nVisit Mpeppe (MPEPE)\n\nJoin and become a community member:\n\nhttps://t.me/mpeppecoin\n\nhttps://x.com/mpeppecommunity?s\u003d11\u0026t\u003dhQv3guBuxfglZI-0YOTGuQ\n\n",

If true, that could reduce election fraud and boost voter turnout.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Blockchain ETF?\n\nA blockchain exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a fund that invests exclusively in a basket of blockchain-based companies. The companies held by a blockchain ETF have business operations in blockchain technology or invest or profit from the blockchain.\n\nBlockchain ETFs—a type of exchange-traded product (ETP)—are distinct from cryptocurrency ETFs, which invest in a basket of digital currencies such as bitcoin. However, a blockchain ETF can provide exposure to some of the technologies that are exploring digital ledger technology.\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain ETFs\n\nA blockchain is a shared ledger that stores all information regarding a transaction (date, time, dollar amount, etc.). This ledger is decentralized, meaning it is not kept in one location but distributed across a network that can be viewed by the public. The information in the ledger is also incorruptible.\n\nProponents believe that blockchain technology can enable people to communicate crucial data in a safe, tamper-proof manner. Just about anything can be recorded and stored on a blockchain network.\n\nBlockchain ETFs give investors a chance to make money from this technology, which has the potential to revolutionize business and be used by everyone. These funds invest in various companies making money from blockchain in some form. Some of them are actively managed while others are passively managed and simply track a specific index.\n\nBlockchain ETFs offer dual benefits—pooled investments in baskets of stocks like that of a mutual fund, and real-time trading with tick-by-tick price changes like that of a stock.\n\nApplications of Blockchain Technology\n\nBlockchain is best known for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of all cryptocurrency transactions. This technology isn’t just limited to digital currencies, though. Blockchain can potentially be used in any situation where data recordkeeping is required.\n\nBlockchain technology can be used to deliver information in a quick, secure, and transparent fashion, even between mutually distrustful parties. Those characteristics have led some proponents to predict that blockchain could end up being as groundbreaking as the internet was.\n\nHow Blockchain Works\n\nA blockchain can in some way be compared to spreadsheets. It is essentially a database where information is entered and stored. Where a blockchain differs from a spreadsheet is in how the data is structured and accessed.\n\nThe blockchain process essentially takes the following steps:Different Services/Industries That Blockchain Is Used in\n\nThousands of cryptocurrency systems run on a blockchain. But that’s not the technology’s only use. Companies in many other industries have explored pilots using blockchains and similar ledger technology to store data for other types of transactions. Proponents believe that it can speed transaction times, demand less oversight and resources, and is harder to hack and manipulate.\n\nThose benefits have prompted several big-name companies to invest in blockchain. Industries that have seen a use for blockchain include:Blockchain ETFs vs. Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe terms bitcoin and blockchain are sometimes used interchangeably, despite being two different things: Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, while blockchain is the underlying database technology.\n\nBlockchain is not tied to any one specific company or product. it is a technology that can be used across various industries. Blockchain ETFs invest in various companies listed on the stock market, many of which also have other operations outside of blockchain, rather than a specific coin. This makes them more diversified and less volatile.\n\nAnother notable difference is regulation and availability. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have been heavily scrutinized by government authorities. For many years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) resisted applications by companies seeking to launch a cryptocurrency ETF, citing fears of market manipulation. The first bitcoin futures ETF in the United States was approved in October 2021, and the first bitcoin spot ETF in January 2024.\n\nCryptocurrency ETFs come with additional risks due to the inherent volatility of digital currency. In addition, they may have higher expense ratios due to the cost of custodying digital assets.\n\nCriticism of Blockchain ETFs\n\nBlockchain ETFs are a relatively recent phenomenon. As such, it is difficult to determine trends or derive conclusive results from their performance.\n\nMany blockchain ETFs have witnessed positive returns.However, investors are still concerned with the long-term prospects of blockchain ETFs. As is the case with any breakthrough technology, there is no guarantee blockchain will live up to its potential and become widely used across multiple industries.\n\nBlockchain ETFs also come with the inherent risk of investing in technology-based startups, at least while the blockchain concept is still evolving, and hitting regulatory roadblocks across the globe.\n\nExample of Blockchain ETFs\n\nTwo popular blockchain ETFs include the Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy (BLCN) ETF and the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing (BLOK) ETF.\n\nThe Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy seeks to replicate the returns of the Siren Nasdaq Blockchain Economy Index, an index made up of global companies committed to blockchain development. The fund is described as passive but does have some discretion in selecting companies.\n\nAs of January 2024, BLCN, which was one of the first ETFs to focus on blockchain technology, had $71.8 million in assets under management and a five-year annualized return of 4.38%. Its top holdings are Galaxy Digital Holdings, Coinbase Global, Inc., and Microstrategy Inc., with an expense ratio of 0.68%.\n\nThe Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF is an actively managed fund investing in companies developing or using what it calls “transformational data sharing technologies.” It has no underlying index and carries an expense ratio of 0.75%.\n\nThe fund, as of January 2024, has assets under management of $850 million and a five-year annualized return of 17.55%. BLOK invests 47% of its assets in technology services and 19% in financial services. Its top holdings, as of October 2023, are Coinbase Global, Inc., Microstrategy, Inc., and Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlockchain ETFs give investors a way to potentially make money from blockchain technology. These ETFs spread their bets on a number of companies at the forefront of blockchain, a technology that some people believe could be as groundbreaking as the internet.\n\nBlockchain is best known for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of all cryptocurrency transactions. But it isn’t just limited to that. Many industries need to record, safely store, and track data, and blockchain has been touted as an effective way to do this.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

    "content": "Hyperbolic, one of the newer contenders in the race to apply blockchain tech to artificial intelligence, has raised $7 million in a seed funding round led by Polychain Capital and Lightspeed Faction.\n\nThe AI boom has strained the global supply chain for graphics processing units (GPUs) and other hardware used to train AI models. Surging hardware prices have squeezed all but the best-resourced AI outfits, making it difficult for startups and researchers to access AI alongside Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Google and Meta.\n\nHyperbolic\u0027s blockchain-based cloud platform aims to make AI hardware affordable for a wider swath of builders.\n\nRead more: Math Olympian in Shadow of John Nash Tries to Solve Blockchain, AI Trust Dilemma\n\n\"Currently, AI companies are reportedly spending over 80% of their capital on compute resources, without a cost-effective solution on the market, and causing an industry-wide bottleneck due to cost and distribution challenges,\" Hyperbolic explained in a statement shared with CoinDesk. \"Hyperbolic’s solution addresses this issue by creating a scalable system to aggregate global GPU compute and leveraging blockchain technology to ensure their network of nodes operates in a verifiable and secure manner.\"\n\nHyperbolic\u0027s first product will be an AI inference service that allows builders to use state-of-the-art AI models \"at a fraction of the cost,\" according to the company. (After an AI model is trained, it makes \"inferences\" based on user requests, such as when ChatGPT responds to user queries.)\n\nIn the long term, the firm plans to build a \"GPU marketplace\" that offers developers and researchers cheaper access to cloud computing hardware for training their own AI models.\n\nThe seed round included participation from Chapter One, LongHash, Bankless Ventures, Republic Digital, Nomad Capital, CoinSummer Labs and Third Earth Capital. It also included angel investors like Balaji Srinivasan, NEAR\u0027s Illia Polosukhin and Polygon\u0027s Sandeep Nailwal.\n\nHyperbolic enters a growing category of startups raising big bucks to build at the intersection of AI and crypto.\n\nEventually, Hyperbolic co-founder Jasper Zhang thinks blockchain projects like his own can be used for more than just addressing AI accessibility hurdles. The pitch from Zhang – a mathematics olympiad winner in China and Russia with a doctorate degree from the University of California, Berkeley – isn\u0027t dissimilar from that of other crypto founders who hypothesize a radical new future where blockchains transform how AI is built and monetized.\n\n\"There will be a lot of other applications building on Hyperbolic,\" he said in an interview with CoinDesk. \"An example could be a GPU futures exchange: Let\u0027s say you tokenize the future usage of a specific GPU and invite traders to come and trade it.\"\n\nZhang also imagines Hyperbolic could be used for \"revenue sharing\" – changing how AI models are monetized. \"You could tokenize the revenue of an AI model, and then the token holder can help the AI model-builder to bootstrap his project.\"\n\n",

    "content": "Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX’s co-founder Nischal Shetty told CoinDesk that outreach efforts to different exchanges \"are going to be crucial,\" as it remains open to \"everything that is possible to help solve this situation.\"\n\nWazirX is effectively closed after the exchange stopped trading and withdrawals after the hack on July 18.\n\nShetty said his exchange would learn from past hacks in one of his first interviews since WazirX lost $230 million earlier this month, saying he hoped other industry players would step in to help relieve his customers\u0027 losses.\n\nIn the past few days, Shetty’s WazirX faced industry and customer heat for a user survey on the next steps, which it clarified was not legally binding, an on-going blame-game with custody provider Liminal over whose system was breached, and the tough question of when the exchange would open to trading again.\n\nOn several questions, Shetty declined to comment citing legal, confidentiality or ongoing investigation obligations.\n\nCustomers and industry colleagues, including at least three co-founders of rival cryptocurrency exchanges, criticized WazirX’s \"Withdrawal Management Programme: Opinion Poll,\" which the exchange revealed over the weekend.\n\nThe opinion poll by WazirX gave customers two choices – access 55% of their funds without withdrawals and get first priority for when potential recovery funds come through or access 55% of their funds with withdrawals with second priority to potential recovery proceeds.\n\nGiven the $230 million hacked amount was 45% of the customer funds, the company is only able to give access to the remaining 55% of funds to its customers. If customers choose option A they will get access to trade 55% of their funds but won’t be able to withdraw and will get first priority on recovered funds over those customers whose funds were not among the stolen funds.\n\nOption B gives customers the choice to get access to 55% of their funds with withdrawals but if funds were recovered they would be second in line to get those funds behind customers whose funds were not stolen.\n\nShetty said the exchange is seeking community consensus and that \"no unilateral decision\" would be taken regarding its proposals. Shetty insisted that the poll was just to gather customer feedback and not to make any decisions. \"That\u0027s why it\u0027s called a poll … we can\u0027t have a poll and then say this is decided,\" he said, adding that the company was not going to move forward with its recovery plan without proper consent.\n\n\"This is a narrative being spread across to scare people,\" Shetty said. \"We are fighting so many things. We thought we\u0027ll put this out for our customers. Unfortunately, it\u0027s been twisted. From the first instance, we said it was not legally binding.\"\n\nThe opinion poll did have a disclaimer that the survey was not legally binding.\n\nThe $230 million in stolen funds, accounted for nearly 45% of WazirX’s user funds. \"We\u0027ve always had one is to one banking, meaning if we have to open we\u0027ll have to make sure it is only with the assets that are collateral,\" Shetty said.\n\nThe July 27 poll was described by the exchange as a \"socialized loss strategy to distribute the impact equitably among all users.\"\n\n\"We will have to rally on the community to decide the way forward,\" Shetty said. \"We are only trying to give more options to the community but we need some time. We are trying to see what other ways we can fill the hole faster.\"\n\nShetty said the exchange can only learn from previous hacks and there can only be two outcomes. The poll was one step to determine what direction should be taken because one way is to take this the judicial proceeding way which \"takes years and years\" but the second is to resume operations with what you have and then fill it up later,\" he said. That way there might be a short-term effect, but in the long term, \"we can resolve this.\" Shetty doubled down on his claim that the exchange will not take any steps without community consensus.\n\nThe co-founder said, \"we are trying everything and anything that helps with the recovery of the stolen funds. We launched a bounty program too.\"\n\nWazirX is running two parallel phases – immediate revival, which helps unlock what is collateralized to the customers, and finding ways to fill the gap, he said.\n\nThe outreach to other exchanges and projects requires WazirX to keep engaging and some percentage of those entities have responded, he said.\n\n\"The outreach to different exchanges is going to be crucial. If we get something positive, someone who steps in to help the customers. And it can be in many ways,\" he said. \"For example, we reached out to all 200 project teams because they also have these emergency funds. They\u0027ll have some way to maybe crowdsource some of these gaps. This is a large gap to fill in a few weeks. But it may be faster with lesser impact if we can figure out how to fill 10%, 20% or 40% of that gap.\"\n\n\"The timeline [for when to make a decision] is what we are trying to come up with,\" Shetty said.\n\nShetty also said that several different Indian and international authorities had been reaching out for help but refused to divulge names. WazirX has already filed a police complaint in Mumbai and reported the incident to the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In).\n\nIndia’s CERT asked WazirX some \"pointed questions,\" Shetty said. He added he believes that\u0027s a sign the entity is investigating the hack. A person familiar with the matter, but unauthorized to speak, said the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was also in touch with the exchange.\n\n\"FBI usually gets after any such situation because it doesn\u0027t want funds to get to North Korea,\" the person said. The FBI has issued statements about similar incidents in the past involving North Korea.\n\nShetty refused to comment on a report which said India\u0027s Enforcement Directorate (ED) put nearly $1.1 million in seized crypto assets in a wallet with WazirX in January, months before the July hack.\n\nWazirX declined to comment on whether a takeover by any other company could be included in the options on the table seeking help.\n\n\"We have reached out to several partners and several exchanges for help,\" Shetty said. Asked if Binance was among those exchanges, Shetty said \"We are bound by confidentiality.\"\n\nBinance and Zanmai Labs, the Singapore-based parent of WazirX, have been embroiled in a public spat around the ownership of the Indian exchange since 2022. The internal dispute became public in August 2022 when Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted Binance didn\u0027t control WazirX, resulting in WazirX co-founder Nischal Shetty hitting back later.\n\nSince then, the entities have been involved in \"private discussions\" to work out their ownership issue.\n\nAsked if those talks had been impacted by the hack, Shetty said \"I\u0027m not legally allowed to speak about it because of our ongoing dispute (with Binance).\"\n\nA person familiar with the matter said a takeover by Binance or any other entity cannot be ruled out in the interest of salvaging the situation and helping customers, conditional on legal requirements.\n\nA Binance spokesperson did not directly respond to CoinDesk’s question about whether Binance was considering buying WazirX out or taking over, but said \"We have been in communication with the WazirX team since July 18 to support their incident response efforts.\"\n\nShetty said he could not disclose how much INR (Indian rupees) WazirX held on its books because that could \"open up a new attack vector for someone right now.\"\n\nHe also cited a lack of regulatory clarity as the reason why WazirX currently does not allow crypto withdrawals.\n\n\"Right now if one person deposits even 10,000 rupees ($120) and then they withdraw that crypto but then after one or two months someone takes a claim to that 10,000 saying this was fraudulently taken from my account by that other person then what happens? Our entire bank account gets frozen. So this is more of a challenge from a regulatory clarity point of view, and a banking thing.\"\n\nRead More: WazirX Surveys Users on Recovery Options After $230M Hack, Leaves Customers and Industry Players Fuming\n\n",

    "summary": "The Ethereum co-founder discusses why his firm decided to sue the SEC on stage at Consensus 2024.\n\n",
    "content": "AUSTIN, TEXAS – Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin is taking the fight to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In late April, his firm, Consensys, decided to preemptively sue the U.S. securities watchdog after receiving what’s known as a Wells notice – or an indication that the agency is building a case against a firm.\n\nOn the Mainstage at Consensus 2024 on Wednesday, the longtime crypto advocate gave a sense of what Consensys is trying to get out of its lawsuit filed “in the great state of Texas.” Namely: regulatory clarity, the preservation of free markets in crypto and a resolution that open source developers will not be targeted.\n\n“What we\u0027re trying to achieve is the freedom to innovate,” Lubin said on stage. “We have been doing our best to thread the needle between offering access to applications and needing to be a regulated financial institution. We\u0027re pretty sure we got it right and continue to get it right,” which is why the SEC’s recent, call it interest, in Ethereum is so worrying.\n\nSee also: ‘It Can Be Said With Confidence the SEC Is Investigating Ethereum’: Consensys’ Bill Hughes Talks Crypto Law\n\nLubin suggested that the SEC has begun to target the biggest players in Ethereum like decentralized exchange Uniswap, the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation and major development studio Consensys precisely because their efforts challenge the potential authority and “vested interests” of regulators and legislators.\n\n“Ethereum represents an existential threat to the weight of life of those who would prefer to perpetuate the system and be a top down control,” Lubin said, adding later that crypto is already changing “the structure of society.”\n\n“We need some sort of deliverance from top down command and control because it\u0027s not working as well as it needs to,” he added.\n\nAt the same time, however, Lubin said that crypto has crossed “the chasm” into American politics, which has become an increasingly popular talking point among speakers. For instance, CEO Tom Farley of Bullish (which owns CoinDesk) and New York Stock Exchange President Lynn Martin agreed on stage that in 10 year’s time it’s unlikely crypto remains a partisan issue.\n\nRead more: NYSE Would Consider Crypto Trading If Regulatory Picture Were Clearer, President Says at Consensus 2024\n\nLikewise, Lubin noted the former President Trump’s embrace of crypto and recent judicial wins have led to a sea-change in how it is being evaluated politically. But he stressed the importance of talking to “all parties that are holding power currently,” even if many in crypto are “more interested in moving beyond the current political constructs” through decentralized tech.\n\n“Most of the people who are empowered by the technology realize that decentralization is consistent with American principles like free market capitalism and democracy,” Lubin said.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A new class of memecoins was birthed on Solana and Ethereum networks over the weekend as the owner of the dog that inspired Dogecoin got a new pup - despite her officially distancing from all such tokens.\n\nKabosu\u0027s owner announced her new Shiba Inu dog, Neiro, on X, sparking the creation of numerous NEIRO tokens on Solana.\n\nTwo prominent NEIRO tokens emerged, with the most popular initially amassing a $100 million market cap but seeing a sell-off later as communities started to argue among each other on which was the actual NEIRO token.\n\nThe trading frenzy propelled Solana\u0027s on-chain volumes to surpass Ethereum\u0027s, with the NEIRO deployer profiting $5.4 million from the token\u0027s popularity.\n\nNeiro\u0027s actual owner has distanced herself from the drama and cautioned users to be on the lookout for \"token scams.\"\n\n",
    "content": "Little did Kabosu’s owner know what was in store when she took to X on Sunday to announce her new Shiba Inu pet, Neiro.\n\nKabosu was the pet dog whose photo birthed the dogecoin (DOGE) memecoin and, subsequently, the $37 billion dog-themed memecoin sector that includes shiba inu (SHIB), floki (FLOKI) and others. Kabosu passed away in May at the age of 17, leaving a legacy that includes a statue and a memecoin worth $18 billion.\n\nBut @Kabosumama, the X account of Kabosu\u0027s human owner, adopted a ten-year-old Shiba Inu dog named Neiro last week, calling her a “new family member.”\n\nInitial replies to that announcement were filled with support for the new pet, but it soon turned into a shill fest as people quickly launched tokens on Solana using Neiro’s liking.\n\nHundreds of Neiro, or Neiro-themed tokens, were issued on Solana token generator Pump Fun, with one quickly running to tens of millions in market capitalization. Later, some traders discovered that while the token at a $100 million capitalization was the most popular, another one was actually the first one to exist – shifting dynamics and causing a brief sell-off.\n\nThe discovery resulted in traders quickly allocating capital to or trading both tokens, resulting in two Solana tokens themed after Neiro—both amassing a cumulative trading volume of $340 million.\n\nSuch trading behavior pushed Solana to the forefront of total blockchain activity on Monday, with on-chain volumes surpassing those of Ethereum, the usual leader. DefiLlama data shows that Solana racked up $1.8 billion in trading volumes each on Sunday and Monday, while Ethereum did under $1 billion.\n\nAs such, the price pump for the NEIRO deemed more popular pocketed its deployer at least $5.4 million in profits, on-chain analysis tool Bubblemaps said in an X post. The deployer bought up a large chunk of the initial supply shortly after the token went live using several wallets, and sold as it went viral.\n\nBoth NEIRO tokens are actively traded and listed on exchanges as of Tuesday. Each community crowns itself as the real one and aims to replicate Dogecoin’s success.\n\nHowever, as far as Neiro’s owner @Kabosumama is concerned, none of the tokens are legitimate.\n\n“I see many tokens related to Kabosu and Neiro. To clarify, I do not endorse any crypto project except @ownthedog $dog because they own the original Doge photo and IP,” she said in an X post. “They are committed to doing only good every day, charitable works, and Doge culture.”\n\n“Please watch out for token scams.”\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Data shows Bitcoin is retesting a historically significant support level after the latest plunge that the asset\u0027s price has gone through.\n\n",
    "content": "On-chain data shows Bitcoin is retesting a historically significant support level after the latest plunge in the asset’s price has gone through.\n\nAs explained by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a new post on X, BTC has returned to the Realized Price of the short-term holders with its drawdown.\n\nThe “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain indicator that, in short, keeps track of the acquisition price or cost basis of the average investor in the Bitcoin sector.\n\nWhen the value of this metric is greater than the cryptocurrency’s spot price, the holders are in a state of net unrealized loss right now. On the other hand, being below the asset’s value implies dominance of profits in the market.\n\nIn the context of the current discussion, the Realized Price of the entire market isn’t of interest, but that of only a segment of it: the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs include all investors who bought their BTC within the past 155 days.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Price specifically for the STHs over the past month:\n\nThe above graph shows that the Bitcoin spot price has declined towards the STH Realized Price in its latest drawdown. This would mean that the break-even point of the STHs is now being retested.\n\nHistorically, this retest has proven to be quite important for the cryptocurrency. The line has served as a transition boundary between bearish and bullish periods.\n\nGenerally, when the asset is in the region above the STH Realized Price, retests of the indicator lead to it reversing back up. Similarly, the line acts as resistance when the coin is under it. The explanation behind this curious pattern may lie in investor psychology.\n\nThe STHs are the fickle-minded hands of the market, who easily react to movements in the asset. As such, they are naturally sensitive to retests of their cost basis and may make moves when they happen.\n\nWhen the atmosphere in the sector is bullish, the STHs usually look at their cost basis as a buying opportunity. This is why the level acts as support during bullish periods. In times of bearish sentiment, these investors may panic sell at their break-even instead, thus providing resistance to the asset.\n\nThe Bitcoin spot price had managed to break through this resistance earlier in the month, but with the plunge, it’s now retesting it again. It remains to be seen if support holds here, confirming the prevalence of a bullish mentality, or a dip under it happens, thus suggesting a transition to a bearish market.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $64,800, down more than 2% over the past 24 hours.\n\n",

    "title": "What Does the Bitcoin Blockchain Record?",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Read about the Bitcoin blockchain, a public ledger shared among all Bitcoin users that records information about every single Bitcoin transaction.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is a publicly-shared list of bitcoin transactions. The information recorded on the blockchain is sent through a cryptographic algorithm that creates hashes used for security and verification. The blockchain consists of files called blocks, which are split up into four fields that organize the data recorded.\n\n",
    "content": "In plain English, the Bitcoin blockchain records transactions and user addresses. In technical terms, it records unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs, the transactions with associated addresses), the block\u0027s size, blockchain version, block header hashes, the Merkle root, the coinbase transaction, timestamps, nonces, and the difficulty target in files called blocks.\n\nTo help you understand what the Bitcoin blockchain records, discussed here are some of the elements of the blockchain that are the most confusing in addition to what is recorded.\n\nInformation Recorded on Bitcoin\u0027s Blockchain\n\nThere is a lot of information recorded in each of Bitcoin\u0027s blocks. For example, the following image displays what is stored in block 854,339. You can see the block hash, the total bitcoins that were transferred in the contained transactions, the number of transactions, and the fees paid to miners.\n\nThe Merkle root, nonce, and timestamp are also all shown. The timestamp is listed as \"Mined on\" with the date. The block also records the address of the miner who received the reward and the reward amount—this block was mined by the AntPool mining pool. If the miner had been an individual, there would only be their address (this block had a coinbase message declaring it as mined by Antpool).\n\nBitcoin Block Construction\n\nThe information in the previous image is stored in the block, which is a file the entire network of full nodes download and store. Blockchains consist of a series of individual blocks (which are files) sequentially numbered based on when they were added to the blockchain and their height (their numerical distance to the first block—in the previous image, the block height is 854,339).\n\nA file is structured with four fields:The transaction field is usually the bulk of the data contained in a block, but the block header is also important.\n\nThe Block Header\n\nThe block header includes six fields:Transactions\n\nOne of the more confusing concepts used in the Bitcoin blockchain is how transactions are recorded. They are not recorded as balance transfers between accounts like accounting ledgers or some other blockchains.\n\nBitcoin records unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs)—how much is left over after a transaction. Here\u0027s how this works: Imagine you buy something for 0.5 BTC but only have a UTXO assigned to you that is 0.75 BTC in value. The network cannot break that 0.75 BTC into smaller amounts. Instead, the network destroys the 0.75 BTC and then creates an output of 0.5 BTC and 0.25 BTC, assigning them to you and the recipient. These two outputs are now UTXOs.\n\nMerkle Root\n\nThe Merkle root is a hash of all of the transactions recorded in the block. It is also used as one of the inputs that generate the block hash.\n\nTo create a Merkle root, a transaction is hashed, then paired with another transaction\u0027s hash, and hashed again. The results continue to be paired and hashed until there are no more hashes to pair, with the result being the Merkle root. This hash serves as the way transactions are verified on the blockchain—when a block is broadcast, every node performs the operations that lead to the block\u0027s state. This only takes each node a millisecond to do, and if the resulting hashes are the same, all transactions are verified.\n\nDifficulty Target\n\nThe difficulty target is the value all miners were trying to generate when they were performing what is commonly called mining—the race to be the first to solve the cryptographic puzzle. Miners hash the block header, which includes the nonce, and see if it\u0027s value is equal to or less than the target. Hashing results in a hexidecimal value which can be converted to decimal form, which is why the target is shown in decimal form in the above image.\n\nIf the resulting hash\u0027s value is higher than the target, the nonce is increased by a value of one, and the block header is hashed again. Bitcoin also uses a value called the extra nonce because the nonce can only be adjusted to about 4.5 billion due to limitations in the field\u0027s size (a modern processor does this in less than one second).\n\nThe extra nonce is stored in the coinbase transaction, which is the first transaction recorded in the block. This transaction is the reward to the miner, and the extra nonce is appended to the transaction.\n\nWhen the right combination of nonce, extra nonce, and hash is found, the miner \"wins\" and the block is broadcast to the network for validation.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain records all transactions, addresses, and relevant data like the block\u0027s size, blockchain version, block header hashes, the Merkle root, the coinbase transaction, timestamps, and nonces.\n\n",

    "content": "An understanding of financial markets would help you familiarize yourself with terms like bull and bear markets. What are animals doing in the world of financial services? Interestingly, the terms bull and bear markets have transitioned effectively from traditional financial services to the crypto landscape.\n\nThe bull market vs bear market comparison with respect to cryptocurrencies can lead to a better understanding of the crypto market. Terms like bull and bear markets describe the performance of stock markets, depending on whether the value is increasing or decreasing. For example, a declining market can be called a bear market, while a growing market is a bull market.\n\nThe crypto market is significantly volatile, and it changes frequently in a day. Therefore, the bull and bear market difference helps in defining the longer periods of upward and downward movement in the market. The modifications that can lead to classification of crypto markets into bull and bear markets are generally substantial, ranging up to 20% in any direction. Let us uncover the bull market vs bear market difference in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nEmbrace the technological leap and global adoption that awaits in the upcoming bull run of 2024-2025 with Crypto Bull Run Ready Career Path.\n\nBull markets generally focus on favorable economic conditions. It suggests that the market is growing and involves positive investor sentiments regarding the crypto market. Another important trait of bull markets is the sustained growth in asset prices alongside higher employment levels and a stronger economy.\n\nYou can understand the difference between bull and bear markets in the crypto space by identifying how bull markets work in crypto. Interestingly, the crypto market witnesses more consistent and stronger Bull Runs. In most cases, a 40% growth in price of crypto assets over a period of one to two days might induce a bull run. Crypto markets are smaller than conventional financial markets and showcase more volatility.\n\nThe bullish sentiments in any market showcase optimism regarding the continuous growth in value of assets. In the crypto space, you can expect the same as favorable economic conditions lead to growth of cryptocurrencies. As a result, investors seek opportunities to capitalize on continuously expanding crypto portfolios.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects!\n\nThe identification of a bull market in the crypto industry focuses on identification of different signals, such as real-life indicators and trading signals. You can review the history of bear and bull markets to recognize the pointers that differentiate bull markets from bear markets. First of all, you must notice the rise in stock prices during a bull run in the crypto market. You can identify a bull market directly by monitoring the price movement of the popular cryptocurrencies alongside the performance of general crypto market. For example, if you notice the prices increasing for a few months or weeks, you can confirm the rise of a bull market.\n\nThe next important differentiator in a bear vs bull market comparison is the growth of trading volume. Significant surges in trading activity can serve as a clearly visible signal for the rise of bull markets. Furthermore, you can also identify a bull market in the crypto space by staying updated with the latest trends in the crypto industry. Positive news and sentiments in the market can improve investor confidence, thereby leading to the formation of bull markets. Speaking of market sentiment, you can determine the level of optimism in crypto markets by using specialized tools such as the Crypto Fear \u0026 Greed Index.\n\nMost important of all, a comprehensive review of bear and bull market history can also help you identify bull markets. Historical market trends show that bull markets happen in cycles. You should determine the average duration of the bull market and review it with respect to existing market conditions to anticipate the timing of the next bull market.\n\nLearn the fundamentals, working principle and the future prospects of cryptocurrencies from Cryptocurrency Fudamentals Ebook\n\nThe bear markets are opposite of bull markets and indicate a decline in the value of crypto assets. You can distinguish a bear market by checking for decline in the value of cryptocurrencies. In bear markets, the value of crypto assets might fall by a minimum of 20% and continue declining. The most famous example of a bull market in crypto refers to the cryptocurrency crash in December 2017. The notorious Bitcoin crash witnessed the fall of the biggest cryptocurrency by a huge margin within a few days. With the downward trend in the bull market, investor confidence would also fall, thereby strengthening the downward pattern.\n\nYou might wonder about queries like “Why is it called a bear market?” while figuring out the reasons and factors influencing the bear market. The patterns in a bull market are similar to the fighting style of a bear. The bear market starts at a high point and then pushes down with all its might, like a bear, as it claws down on the prey.\n\nIn the bear market, you would notice slow economic growth and higher unemployment rates. The conditions of the bear market might emerge from geopolitical crises, natural disasters, popping of market bubbles, and poor economic policies. Most importantly, bear markets feature limited optimism from investors due to negative sentiment.\n\nWant to get an in-depth understanding of crypto fundamentals, trading and investing strategies? Enroll now in Crypto Fundamentals, Trading And Investing Course.\n\nThe process of recognizing bear markets in crypto is almost similar to that of recognizing bull markets. You can find out the bull and bear market differences by checking different real-life signals and trading indicators. Just like bull markets, a bear market would showcase a similar trend, albeit with a downward pattern.\n\nBear markets showcase a continuous decline in performance of crypto assets for a long period of time. If you notice an abrupt and long-lasting downturn, then you can expect that it might be a bear market. On top of it, signs of rising unemployment rates could indicate downfall of the broader financial market.\n\nThe next crucial sign of a bear market is the exponential growth in market volatility. Sharp price declines of crypto assets, especially the big players, might suggest the possibility of an impending bear market. You must also compare the bull market vs bear market by evaluating important economic indicators. The notable economic indicators you must watch out for to predict bear markets include inflation and interest rates. It is also important to look out for negative developments in the crypto space, such as security breaches or regulatory crackdowns.\n\nStart learning about Cryptocurrencies with World’s first Cryptocurrency Skill Path with quality resources tailored by industry experts Now!\n\nThe comparison between bull and bear markets largely revolves around the direction of prices of cryptocurrencies. However, you can pay attention to specific factors that can mark the difference between bull markets and bear markets in crypto. Here are the notable highlights you can find in a comparison between bull and bear markets in the crypto space.\n\nThe demand for cryptocurrencies is strong in bull markets owing to positive investor confidence. It can lead to rising prices of crypto assets as investors compete against each other to buy available crypto assets. On the other hand, people are more inclined to sell their crypto assets in a bear market. With supply outperforming demand, bull markets are generally characterized by declining prices of crypto assets.\n\nAnother notable aspect of the difference between a bull and bear market is liquidity. You can notice higher liquidity in a bullish market as crypto assets are tradable at lower transaction fees. However, bear markets in crypto have lower liquidity due to the lack of trust in the market condition.\n\nYou can distinguish a bear market from a bull market by the impact on the economy. In bear markets, you can notice declining levels of GDP, while bull markets indicate possibilities for a rise in GDP. Increasing GDP in a bull market also accompanies growth in companies’ revenue alongside better employment prospects. Therefore, it leads to better and positive market sentiment.\n\nOn the other side, falling GDP levels would lead to economic recessions and failure to meet revenue goals. It would subsequently lead to negative market sentiments, and people would hesitate before investing in crypto assets. Bear markets are also known for lowering employment levels that, subsequently, extend the duration of bear markets.\n\nHere is an overview of the differences between bear and bull markets.\n\n\n\nThe differences between bull markets and bear markets in the crypto space show a different aspect of cryptocurrencies. You should learn more about the bull vs bear market comparisons, as they can help you find the ideal ways around the crypto market. The volatility of the cryptocurrency market is one of the biggest concerns of investors.\n\nHowever, the ability to identify bear and bull markets can help you avoid doubts regarding uncertain trends in the crypto market. The simplest explanation for the difference between bear and bull markets is the difference in pricing trends of cryptocurrencies. Find out more about the history of bull and bear markets in the crypto industry.\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer: The article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide any investment advice.

    "content": "In the volatile landscape of cryptocurrency, fortunes can change rapidly. Shiba Inu (SHIB), once a beacon of hope for meme coin enthusiasts, is currently navigating through turbulent waters. This instability has led many investors to seek more promising alternatives, with Mpeppe (MPEPE) emerging as a popular choice.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB), once a darling of the crypto community, has been facing some challenges. The live price of Shiba Inu is $0.000017 per SHIB/USD, with a market cap of $9.86 billion USD and a 24-hour trading volume of $206.88 million USD. Despite these impressive figures, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is down 2.78% in the last 24 hours, highlighting the volatility and inconsistency in its performance.\n\nA significant factor contributing to Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) recent performance issues is the lack of token burn activity in the past 24 hours, marking a 100% decrease. However, on a weekly basis, the SHIB burn rate increased by 71.56%, with 128,452,453 Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens burned, highlighting efforts to boost token scarcity. Despite these efforts, the immediate impact on market sentiment remains muted.\n\nShiba Inu’s (SHIB) market dynamics are also influenced by varied trading signals. Platforms like Coinbase and Binance have seen strong buy activity, while OKX and Bullish have experienced dominant sell-offs. This mixed trading activity indicates that while some traders are taking positions, others are cashing out, leading to a lack of clear direction for Shiba Inu (SHIB).\n\nThe Shiba Inu (SHIB) community has been proactive in enhancing the token’s value. A notable effort is the ongoing campaign to have Binance burn 1% of trading fees, which has seen substantial support.

    "content": "Blackbird Labs, the restaurant loyalty platform founded by Resy and Eater co-founder Ben Leventhal, announced the launch of Blackbird Pay, a system that will allow participating restaurants to accept payment in cryptocurrency.\n\nBlackbird, backed by American Express and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), raised more than $24 million last year amid a wider mania around Web3. The initial pitch for the platform – available in New York, San Francisco and Charleston – was to provide diners with a way to earn rewards and exclusive perks from some of their favorite restaurants.\n\nFor the notoriously finicky restaurant business, the platform aimed to drive traffic and deliver new streams of revenue.\n\nThe new payments platform expands on Blackbird\u0027s mission by allowing consumers to pay for their meals using the $FLY cryptocurrency. The tokens can be earned as loyalty points for dining at participating restaurants or purchased in the Blackbird app using Coinbase\u0027s popular USDC stablecoin.\n\nThe restaurants may also have an incentive to participate, since they could avoid merchant card fees.\n\n\"Lower than typical credit card fees, which can be as high as 3.75%, restaurants on the Blackbird Pay network pay a flat fee of 2% per transaction, saving them money on every transaction,\" Blackbird Labs explained in a statement shared with CoinDesk. \"At the same time, Blackbird Pay enhances diners’ end of meal experience by enabling them to skip the dreaded ‘Let’s get the check’ moment and enjoy the magic of paying their check in-app at any point; so, they can leave whenever they’re ready, just like having an old-school house account.\"\n\nIt\u0027s all powered by the new Blackbird Mainnet, a layer-3 blockchain based on top of Coinbase\u0027s Base chain. Base, a so-called layer-2 network, offers users a fast and cheap option for transacting on the popular Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBlackbird\u0027s co-founder, Leventhal, has spent two decades in the restaurant industry and previously founded Resy, the reservation platform, and Eater, a major food-focused media outlet.\n\nIn an interview with CoinDesk, Leventhal described restaurants as a \"humongous industry made up of tiny players.\" Unlike airlines and hotels, which are dominated by large players, restaurants \"don\u0027t have leverage individually,\" said Leventhal, which is why they are so rarely profitable.\n\nRead more: Blackbird, Crypto Restaurant App, Raises $24M in Funding Led by A16z\n\n\"For me, the best restaurants are not necessarily the ones with four stars, but the ones where you walk in and you just immediately understand you\u0027re in exactly the right place, and there\u0027s no place better for you to be at that moment,\" said Leventhal. \"As good as they are at all that, they\u0027re just terrible in terms of managing profitably.\"\n\n\"It\u0027s impossible to predictably grow revenue, and they\u0027re paying a lot of fees for a lot of things on the technology side. In particular, the fees that they pay for processing are incredibly high,\" Leventhal continued. \"That\u0027s where Blackbird comes in. We are endeavoring to build a platform in partnership with the restaurant industry that\u0027s focused on rewards and payments, and we think those are the levers to really creating massively improved operating margins and massively improved strategy.\"\n\n",

    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "Discover three ways to increase transparency and mitigate risk around token bridges to help protect end users.\n\n",
    "content": "Driven by the demand for a more holistic Web3 user experience, cross-chain bridges are used to transfer digital assets from one blockchain network to another through wrapped tokens—one-to-one digital representations of tokens from another blockchain. They’re needed because blockchains are generally not interoperable by default. Wrapped tokens unlock cross-chain liquidity, but often require additional trust assumptions compared to assets native to a single blockchain.\n\nCross-chain token bridges face an array of security challenges, from securing private keys to ensuring airtight smart contract code. Developers must take a comprehensive defense-in-depth approach to cross-chain bridge architecture, with independent layers of security at every step, from technical to social.\n\nCross-chain bridge security shouldn’t just be reactive; it should proactively account for the possibilities of an attack or exploit and protect against the potential outcomes. The key question is: What do you do when a carefully laid security plan goes awry?Regardless of how a bridge is compromised, there are often two immediate risks that come from bridge attacks and exploits.\n\nUser funds on the source blockchain are stolen and corresponding wrapped tokens are no longer fully backed. Because wrapped assets only hold value due to their cross-chain backing, stealing locked assets on the source blockchain effectively makes corresponding wrapped assets worthless.\n\nKnown as an “infinite mint” exploit, this is when an excess of wrapped tokens without sufficient reserves are minted, meaning they are no longer sufficiently collateralized. Infinite mint exploits lead to fractional reserve practices, and malicious actors can take advantage of this by either selling the wrapped token assets on a decentralized exchange or using the tokens as collateral on a lending market.\n\nA compromised cross-chain token bridge poses an immediate risk not only to bridge users but also to any project that directly integrates support for the wrapped token. Wrapped tokens are often used within DeFi protocols, and an exploit or hack can significantly impact operations and sometimes lead to protocol insolvency.\n\nFor example, using wrapped tokens as collateral within a pooled DeFi lending market can put users at risk, even if they only lend or borrow network-native assets. If a wrapped token used as collateral is exploited, it can result in the loss of lender (or protocol) funds, leading to insolvencies that can not only impact users, but cause ripple effects across the wider ecosystem.\n\nAs cross-chain token bridges and their wrapped tokens gain adoption, the ecosystem risk, if a bridge’s security is compromised, grows.\n\nChainlink Proof of Reserve (PoR) provides smart contracts with the information needed to calculate the true collateralization of any cross-chain reserves backing wrapped tokens. Operated by a decentralized network of oracles, Chainlink Proof of Reserve verifies cross-chain collateral—acting as a data layer for a wrapped token bridge.\n\nNote: Chainlink PoR increases transparency into the reserves backing wrapped tokens, and can be used for additional safeguard features, but doesn’t prevent a cross-chain bridge from being drained due to an exploit. Rather, PoR can be used by bridges and dApps to help mitigate the impact of such events.\n\nThere are 3 main benefits to using Chainlink Proof of Reserve for wrapped tokens.\n\nA robust and decentralized reserve data feed gives bridge developers the tools to build automatic fail-safe measures that can halt the minting, redeeming, and burning of a wrapped token. For example, one way to help protect against infinite mint attacks is to use Chainlink Proof of Reserve data feeds to check if there is an equal or greater amount of reserves than wrapped tokens. If there aren’t, the minting of additional wrapped tokens is reverted.\n\nBecause on-chain reserve data from Chainlink Proof of Reserve can help serve as a critical fail-safe in case of a bridge exploit or hack, it’s important that data feeds are secure, reliable, and accurate even in outlier circumstances.\n\nBy leveraging a decentralized, Sybil-resistant network of nodes run by proven node operators, Chainlink Proof of Reserve provides best-in-class cross-chain reserve verification services, with updates reliably posted on-chain regardless of market or network conditions.\n\nRobust on-chain proof of reserves surrounding wrapped tokens through Chainlink PoR enables DeFi developers to build in protections against potential bridge hacks or exploits. This helps mitigate DeFi contagion risk, and as more DeFi protocols implement these failsafe measures, ecosystem resiliency and anti-reflexivity will grow.\n\nFor example, DeFi lending protocols could add circuit breakers that automatically pause lending pools using wrapped assets as collateral by reading data from Chainlink PoR data feeds. If there aren’t enough reserves locked on the source blockchain, the DeFi lending protocol can then automatically halt operations to reduce the severity of the event.\n\nA good proof of reserves solution for wrapped token assets makes it easy for DeFi developers to leverage the data for this exact reason. To lower the bar for implementations, reserve data feeds should be simple to implement, use a standardized solution, and be posted natively on-chain.\n\nAs the industry-standard oracle solution for DeFi protocols, with over five billion data points delivered to blockchains, Chainlink Proof of Reserve enables DeFi developers to easily integrate reserve data into their dApp in just three steps.\n\nAutomating data delivery on cross-chain reserves enables users to seamlessly verify the collateral backing of a wrapped token and quickly make informed decisions during outlier events—a key competitive edge for wrapped asset issuers looking to gain user adoption. Without proof of reserves, it can be difficult for users to verify on-chain that wrapped assets correspond on a one-to-one basis with assets on the source blockchain.\n\nOne key consideration is that exploits or hacks can happen quickly. Reserve data feeds should be designed to update on-chain in near real-time to give users maximum transparency into the state of the cross-chain bridge, particularly when it’s most needed.\n\nThat’s why Chainlink Proof of Reserve checks token reserves off-chain at regular intervals and updates the reserve data on-chain when it reaches a deviation threshold or heartbeat trigger, helping ensure real-time updates during unexpected events while saving on gas costs when reserves remain stable.\n\nBringing reserve data to blockchains provides crucial protection for cross-chain token bridges by enabling anyone to independently verify the collateral backing a wrapped token and projects to integrate automate failsafes in the event of a hack or exploit.\n\nTo find out more about how you can use Chainlink to help ensure the security of your wrapped token asset or DeFi protocol, reach out to our experts.\n\n",

    "content": "Machine learning and deep learning have been through a revolutionary transition in the last decade. Most of the work around these two technologies had been limited to research labs. However, it is important to note that the two most prominent disciplines of artificial intelligence have emerged as lifesavers for many businesses. The Keras vs. TensorFlow debate has been gaining attention as they are the most popular deep learning frameworks that can help machine learning and deep learning engineers. It is important to note that machine learning and deep learning engineers have to work on larger data sets that continue expanding.\n\nTensorFlow and Keras can help developers achieve more functionality with data alongside exercising better control on training ML models. Let us explore the differences between TensorFlow and Keras to determine the best pick among them.\n\n\n\nKeras is an open-source, high-level neural network library created by Google engineer Francois Chollet. The primary objective of creating Keras was focused on improving the accessibility of deep learning. The Keras and TensorFlow difference is visible in the fact that you don’t need coding expertise to develop neural networks with Keras.\n\nIt offers a high-level API that can help in abstraction of complexities associated with deep learning. On top of that, Keras also offers pre-build layers, optimizers, and activation functions that help you focus on designing the model rather than worrying about technicalities. Keras has been developed with Python programming language, thereby helping Python programmers learn its functionalities with ease.\n\nBefore you compare Keras and TensorFlow, you must know that Keras stands out for its simplicity and adaptability. It helps you explore model designs and enables faster prototyping with the features for examining performance of different designs as you adjust hyperparameters. Keras has been instrumental in fuelling advancements in natural language processing, speech recognition, and computer vision.\n\nTake your first step towards learning about artificial intelligence through AI Flashcards\n\nTensorFlow is another powerhouse in the domain of deep learning and AI. It is the most renowned deep learning framework, primarily because it was created by Google Brain team. Questions like “Is Keras the same as TensorFlow?” emerge from the fact that both of them are open-source libraries.\n\nIn the case of TensorFlow, the library is tailored for numerical computation tasks that leverage data flow graphs. TensorFlow helps in conducting computations on GPUs, CPUs, and distributed systems by using nodes to represent mathematical operations. The edges in TensorFlow represent data flow channels.\n\nTensorFlow helps in creating different ML and deep learning models. It helps deep learning researchers create different types of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. Developers can use TensorFlow with different programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python. The primary objective of TensorFlow revolves around training ML models on large datasets to help them make faster decisions. TensorFlow has emerged as a trusted tool for use in cases such as image recognition, natural language processing, recurrent neural networks, and word embeddings.\n\nWant to understand the importance of ethics in AI, ethical frameworks, principles, and challenges? Enroll now in Ethics Of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Course\n\nThe overview of TensorFlow and Keras shows that both of them are similar in many ways. However, the Keras and TensorFlow compatibility is significantly limited, as there are multiple differences between them. Here is an overview of some of the notable differences between TensorFlow and Keras.\n\nThe best way to compare TensorFlow with Keras would involve finding out their use cases. TensorFlow is more flexible and has robust features to manage and process large data sets. It is useful for research as well as practical applications in the domain of AI. Some of the most notable use cases of TensorFlow include image recognition, generative models, image synthesis, and predictive analytics.\n\nConvolutional Neural Networks use TensorFlow for better performance in image classification, facial recognition, and object detection. The capabilities of TensorFlow for prediction of numerical values by leveraging historical data can be useful for regression and predictive analytics tasks. On top of that, TensorFlow can power GANs that help create realistic videos, synthesize images, augment data, and improve visual effects.\n\nOn the other hand, in the TensorFlow vs. Keras comparison, Keras is more useful for different machine learning tasks. It is the top choice of developers for natural language processing tasks, reinforcement learning, and transfer learning. Keras helps power NLP applications such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and text classification.\n\nDevelopers can use the Keras API to implement reinforcement learning algorithms that can power autonomous systems and robotics. Another important use of Keras is transfer learning, which helps in creating pre-trained models that you can fine-tune for specific tasks.\n\n\n\nThe next crucial point for comparison between TensorFlow and Keras is the outline of important features that differentiate the frameworks. You might assume that the Keras and TensorFlow differences would turn in favor of TensorFlow with its diverse features. TensorFlow offers a wide range of features such as a powerful computation engine, TensorBoard visualization, deep learning environment AutoGraph, and eager execution.\n\nIt also includes a collection of pre-trained models in the TensorFlow Hub that can help in using existing models for different tasks such as NLP and image recognition. TensorBoard visualization and AutoGraph are the most valuable features of TensorBoard for machine learning and deep learning workloads.\n\nKeras also has a collection of powerful features that make it a worthy competitor to TensorFlow.

    "content": "Mercado Bitcoin (MB), the largest digital asset platform in Latin America, has made its first on-chain sale of Digital Fixed Income tokens on an international platform using TradeFinex technology powered by XDC Network. This is boosting the global Real World Asset (RWA) market, which is expected to be worth US$ 16 trillion and account for 10% of the world’s GDP by 2030, according to estimates by the Boston Consulting Group.\n\nThe logistics company Ascensus backed the product by a RWA token and was made available through the layer 1 blockchain XDC Network used by TradeFinex. This is the world’s first on-chain case related to an RWA from a Brazilian company in the international market.\n\nThe dollar-token matures in 3 months with a 9.2% yearly return – a significantly higher percentage when compared to US treasury bonds, which tracks the country’s interest rate of 5.25% and 5.5% per year.\n\n“We are replicating in the international market the B2B services and products that we already offer solidly in Brazil to drive out this expansion,” says Roberto Dagnoni, CEO of 2TM, MB’s parent company. “The distribution of Digital Fixed Income assets, a product in which we are pioneers, is already widely carried out for Brazilian clients (institutional and retail) and is accelerating in Portugal,” he adds.\n\nMB already operates in the international market with Mercado Bitcoin Portugal, which has issued 23 products valuing US$ 18 million since the company was acquired by MB in 2022. The on-chain scenario is also contributing to the international expansion of MB, which also has representation in Germany, highlighting the potential for international business.\n\n“We have set up an international sales team focused on finding partners who distribute RWA of Brazilian corporate debt worldwide. Brazil is the country with the second highest real interest rate in the world and therefore has a high concentration of this asset class locally. This expansion strengthens foreign investors’ accessibility to differentiated Brazilian products and creates a new source of credit for national companies”, said Henrique Pocai, MB’s sales director.\n\nFor TradeFinex, this is an opportunity to showcase the RWA tokenization capability of the XDC network. In addition, sales took place in an automated way using smart contract technology, with minimal manual input – which highlights the technology involved. Any institution can create and use TradeFinex’s open source platform by submitting their details via this form to join this TradeFi platform’s Real World Asset RWA pool.\n\n“Brazil plays an important role in trade finance; however, access to international credit is a significant challenge, especially for SMEs. This pilot project emerges as a solution to address this issue” said Diego Consimo, Head of LATAM at XDC Network and TradeFinex representative in Brazil. “Once more the XDC Network stands out as a robust platform for tokenization, providing scalable and efficient blockchain solutions that facilitate seamless digital asset management and compliance with global regulatory standards” he adds.\n\nFrom global trade finance and payments to DePIN and RWA tokenization, XDC enables secure, scalable, and highly efficient solutions. As the XDC Network continues to attract major players like Deutsche Telekom who recently started running node for XDC Network and facilitate groundbreaking projects like Mercado Bitcoin’s on-chain token, the demand and value of XDC are still undervalued in the current market with a chance of exploding to a new high anytime.\n\nThe current price of XDC is $0.030393 with a market cap of $453,268,924 USD. It is 80 % lower than its all-time high of $0.193 and nearly 20000% higher than its all-time low of $0.0001571. XDC is available on multiple CEX and DEX including the top 10 exchanges namely Gate.io, HTX, Bitfinex, Kucoin.\n\nPhoto by Traxer on Unsplash\n\n",

    "content": "As the cryptocurrency market continues to thrive, Ethereum (ETH) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are gaining significant attention from investors. Ethereum is making strides toward the $3,500 mark, while Mpeppe’s presale success has investors eyeing potential 300x gains. Here’s a closer look at these two exciting opportunities.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been a cornerstone in the cryptocurrency market, continuously evolving and adapting to new trends. Currently, the live price of Ethereum is $3,345.24, with a market cap of $402.19 billion USD and a 24-hour trading volume of $17.13 billion USD. Despite a slight dip of 0.64% in the last 24 hours, Ethereum’s performance remains robust with a circulating supply of 120.23 million Ethereum (ETH).\n\nThe introduction of Ethereum ETFs on July 22 has significantly influenced its market dynamics. Within the first week, these ETFs garnered over $4 billion in trading volume, initially causing a price drop of 13.37% as traders took profits. However, the sentiment shifted positively following a bullish speech by Donald Trump at the Bitcoin Conference 2024, leading to an 8.74% price increase for Ethereum (ETH) by July 29.\n\nTechnical analysis for Ethereum (ETH) suggests a promising upward trend. Key indicators like the Ichimoku Cloud point towards potential resistance breakouts at $3,349 and $3,500. Should Ethereum successfully breach these levels, it could aim for $3,800. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) above 50 and rising open interest indicate heightened investor confidence and potential for increased volatility, suggesting that Ethereum might soon challenge new highs.\n\nWhile Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the headlines, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a formidable player in the meme coin market. Currently trading at $0.00107 USDT in its Stage 2 presale, Mpeppe has already sold almost 60% of its tokens. This rapid sale underscores growing investor confidence in Mpeppe’s potential for significant returns.\n\nInnovative Features: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another meme coin; it integrates decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming platforms, offering real utility to its users. This dual functionality provides value beyond the typical meme coin hype.\n\nStrong Community Support: Much like Ethereum (ETH), Mpeppe benefits from a robust and active community. Social media promotions and community discussions have played a crucial role in boosting Mpeppe’s popularity, driving investor interest and engagement.\n\nHigh Return Potential: Analysts predict that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could achieve a 300x rise, making it an attractive investment for those looking to capitalize on early-stage opportunities. The successful presale highlights the growing market presence and investor confidence in Mpeppe’s potential.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is poised for substantial growth in 2024, with both established coins like Ethereum (ETH) and emerging tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE) offering significant profit potential.\n\nEthereum (ETH): With its price targeting $3,500 and beyond, Ethereum continues to solidify its position as a leading cryptocurrency. The successful launch of Ethereum ETFs has injected fresh liquidity into the market, setting the stage for potential price surges.\n\nMpeppe (MPEPE): The presale success and innovative features of Mpeppe (MPEPE) make it a compelling investment. With almost 60% of tokens sold in the current presale phase, Mpeppe is rapidly gaining traction. Investors seeking high returns should consider adding Mpeppe to their portfolios for potential 300x gains.\n\nAs Ethereum (ETH) eyes the $3,500 mark and Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues its presale success, 2024 promises to be a lucrative year for cryptocurrency investors. Both coins offer unique opportunities, with Ethereum (ETH) providing stability and growth, while Mpeppe presents a high-risk, high-reward scenario. The smart contract address for Mpeppe (MPEPE) is 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B. With the right mix of established assets and emerging tokens, investors can diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the dynamic crypto market.\n\nBy staying informed and making strategic investments, you can potentially achieve significant returns in the evolving world of cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\nFor more information on the Mpeppe (MPEPE) Presale:\n\nVisit Mpeppe (MPEPE)\n\nJoin and become a community member:\n\nhttps://t.me/mpeppecoin\n\nhttps://x.com/mpeppecommunity?s\u003d11\u0026t\u003dhQv3guBuxfglZI-0YOTGuQ\n\n",

    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) nosedived over 3% at the start of Asian trading hours amid a broader stock market rout and weakening sentiment for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies.\n\nBTC fell from over $65,500 to nearly $64,000 within minutes at the start of Tokyo trading. The sudden plunge led to over $250 million bullish bets being liquidated, the worst hit since early July.\n\nLiquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. Such data is beneficial for traders as it serves as a signal of leverage being effectively washed out from popular futures products – acting as a short-term indication of a decline in price volatility.\n\nThe broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by capitalization, minus stablecoins, fell by 3.3%.\n\nEther (ETH) longs lost the most at $100 million, driven by a 7.5% slump in the token amid outflows from the newly launched ETH ETF.\n\nBinance recorded the highest liquidations among exchanges at $118 million, of which 88% were long trades. OKX and Huobi – popular among Asia-based traders – recorded as much as 94% of long traders opened on their exchange liquidated.\n\nThe dive came as U.S. technology stocks took a hit on Wednesday, causing the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index to lose 660 points, its biggest drop since 2022.\n\nMixed quarterly earnings from Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA) saw shares of the firms close as low as 12% on Wednesday; in aggregate, the so-termed “Magnificent 7” tech stocks lost more than $750 billion in market cap on Wednesday, the most on record for the group.\n\nLosses spread over to Asian markets early Thursday as Japan’s Nikkei 225 slumped more than 3% amid concerns that the Bank of Japan could hike interest rates.\n\n",

    "summary": "Amazon Web Services gets into the hosted blockchain-as-a-service game, competing with established tech stalwarts like IBM and Oracle\n\n",
    "content": "Amazon Web Services (AWS), the secure cloud services platform from Amazon.com, Inc (AMZN) that offers computational power, data storage, content delivery, and hosting services, has made a foray into the newly emerging “blockchain-as-a-service” (BaaS) offering.\n\nThe new service from AWS was launched late last week under the name AWS Blockchain Templates, and will now allow AWS to directly compete against similar offerings from Oracle Corp (ORCL) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM).\n\nHow does Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) Work?\n\nThough blockchain is acknowledged as an efficient and secure data storage system, the process of creating, running, and managing a blockchain is very complex. This complexity has led many businesses and enterprises to stay away from implementing this efficient system, despite the numerous benefits it offers.\n\nTo tackle this problem, the BaaS model allows “outsourcing” blockchain operational work, allowing the purchasing business to focus on its core business activities. (See also, How Blockchain is Revolutionizing Content Distribution.)Think about BaaS as a way to rent a blockchain from a blockchain hosting provider, who takes care of getting started and having the required blockchain deployed and configured to your choice within minutes on their own servers. This is akin to Software As A Service (SaaS) model commonly used in the information technology industry.\n\nThe Baas space is getting crowded with global tech giants already in the game. During March of last year, IBM became the first premier organization to unveil its Hyperledger-based blockchain-as-a-service offering. It was followed by another tech giant, Oracle, launching its similar cloud-based service that was built on the open-source Hyperledger Fabric project. Chinese companies like Baidu Inc (BIDU) and Tencent are already in the game, and the leading global information and communications technology (ICT) solutions provider Huawei announced its Hyperledger-based blockchain service last week in China.\n\nOther reports indicate that Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL) is also working on a blockchain product that is expected to be offered through its cloud business. Additionally, Hyperledger Cello is a similar hosted blockchain utility of the Hyperledger project that is gaining traction in the corporate world. (See also: Why Google is Building its Own Blockchain?)AWS Blockchain Templates\n\nUsing AWS Blockchain Templates, one can quickly set up Ethereum- or Hyperledger Fabric-compatible blockchain networks. AWS templates are certified to work as open-source frameworks, which allow easy, instant deployment and configuration of blockchain software that helps a business create their own instance of a decentralized network as per their choice. One can select distributed consensus algorithms and access control features of their choice. Following that, the business can create the other necessary artifacts for the network, like smart contracts, apps, and permission and access control system, which are necessary to carry on smooth transactions on the blockchain.\n\nAWS Blockchain Templates offer the clients necessary tools for easy management, monitoring, and real-time browsing of their hosted blockchains. Like the standard SaaS billing model, AWS Blockchain Templates are charged on a “Pay-as-you-go” basis, where the client pays only for the service and resources used. AWS also offers on-demand start-up and shut-down functionality to best fit the business needs.\n\nLike any self-hosted and self-operated blockchain, such BaaS blockchains will find use across a variety of industry applications, including those for financial services, supply chain management, Internet of Things, and healthcare.

He noted that the digital asset currently trades around $65,000 with a market cap of $1.3 trillion and accounts for 0.1% of world assets.\n\nFrom a bearish point of view, the Microstrategy CEO believes Bitcoin will at least achieve a $3 million price mark which should translate into a market cap of $68 trillion. If such predictions are realized, the asset is expected to represent 2% of global assets. Alternatively, in the most bullish case, Michael Saylor projects BTC to be trading at $49 million per unit in 2045 with a staggering market cap of $1.030 trillion. At such heights, Bitcoin will provide an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of 37, while representing 22% of all financial assets in the world.\n\nHowever, for a base scenario, Saylor projects Bitcoin to hit a market price of $13 million, which will allow the asset to gain a 7% market dominance with market shares valued at $280 trillion. Under these conditions, Bitcoin is expected to offer an ARR of 29%.\n\nSaylor’s audacious predictions add to the overflow of positive sentiments in the crypto market among many other developments. Notably, the US Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump has recently restated his commitment to the crypto industry, with the intention of turning the US into the “Bitcoin superpower” of the world if elected into office. In addition, a potential rise in the adoption of Bitcoin spot ETFs also remains on the cards. The possible participation of traditional finance giants in this market could spell many gains for BTC in the coming years.\n\n\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $67,222 reflecting a loss of 1.37% in the last day. However, the crypto asset is also up by 10.12% on the monthly chart. With respect to price movement, BTC’s next major price resistance lies at the $71,000 price mark. If the token is unable to move past this zone, it is expected to retest at $65, 000.\n\n",

    "summary": "In the rush to lock down the blockchain market, two tech giants are neck-and-neck.\n\n",
    "content": "Although blockchain is frequently misunderstood, and despite the fact that many of its applications outside of the cryptocurrency realm remain theoretical, companies of all kinds are rushing to explore what this new technology has to offer. Countless startups are aiming to corner a small portion of the blockchain space with revolutionary applications of the distributed ledger technology. Even banks and other firms not previously directly involved in the tech space are exploring the possibilities in blockchain. It perhaps comes as no surprise, then, that some of the most ardent blockchain innovators are major tech operations. These companies have a direct interest and experience in the space, and they also have the tremendous resources available to dedicate staff, time, and money toward building new blockchain applications.\n\nRecently, a report by iPR Daily indicated that two tech giants in particular have taken the lead when it comes to blockchain development, at least with regards to the number of blockchain-related patents they have secured. Alibaba (BABA) and IBM (IBM) are neck-and-neck, each holding close to 100 patents already.\n\nAlibaba and IBM\n\nAlibaba had 90 blockchain-related patents as of the end of August, while IBM was just behind with a total of 89, according to the report, cited by Coin Telegraph. Mastercard came in third place with 80 filings. Proving that banks are increasingly involving themselves in blockchain, Bank of America took the fourth place on the list with 53 patents.\n\nGeographical Interest\n\nWhile the report utilized information covering Asia, the EU, America, and elsewhere in the world, it seems clear that most of the blockchain patents are concentrated in China. In 2017, for instance, Chinese companies filed 225 applications for blockchain patents, while American companies only filed 91. This is all in spite of the fact that China\u0027s government has clamped down on cryptocurrencies, even as blockchain technology has proliferated there. Alibaba head Jack Ma exemplifies this stance as a business leader; he has previously expressed skepticism about digital currencies and has also discussed his great optimism for blockchain as a technology.\n\nIBM may take over the top position at any time. The stalwart computer maker recently signed a 5-year, $740 million deal with the Australian government to integrate blockchain, among other technologies, into data security and automation.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

    "content": "U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis\u0027s plan for a new Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would finance purchases of the cryptocurrency partly by revaluing gold certificates held by the Federal Reserve System, according to a draft of the legislation obtained by CoinDesk.\n\nLummis, a Wyoming Republican who is known for her Bitcoin-friendly policy stance, announced her intention to propose the reserve on Saturday at the Bitcoin Nashville conference. She came onstage just minutes after former U.S. President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee in this year\u0027s presidential race, delivered a speech on blockchain policy before the cheering room, filled to its 8,500-person capacity.\n\nRead More: The U.S. Government May Begin Hoarding Bitcoin, But How and Why?\n\nTrump, during this speech, endorsed using the U.S. government\u0027s existing bitcoin holdings – primarily obtained through forfeitures and seizures related to criminal cases – to form the \"core\" of a new \"strategic national bitcoin stockpile.\"\n\nAccording to the draft bill, under the working short title of \"Bitcoin Act of 2024,\" the Treasury secretary would \"establish a decentralized network of secure Bitcoin storage facilities distributed across the U.S.,\" selecting the locations for the vaults \"based on a comprehensive risk assessment, prioritizing geographic diversity, security and accessibility.\"\n\nThe Treasury secretary would establish a \"Bitcoin Purchase Program\" of up to 200,000 BTC a year over a five-year period, for a total of 1 million, according to the draft. The bitcoin would be held for at least 20 years and could only be disposed of for the purpose of paying off federal debt. After that, no more than 10% of the assets could be sold during any two-year period.\n\nThe bitcoin purchases would be financed through a few methods, describe in the draft bill as \"offsetting the cost of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.\"\n\nThe plan calls for the setting aside of $6 billion from any net earnings remitted by Federal Reserve to the Treasury from fiscal years 2025 through 2029, and it would reduce the discretionary surplus funds of Federal Reserve banks to $2.4 billion from $6.825 billion, the level that\u0027s currently stipulated in the Federal Reserve Act.\n\nThere\u0027s also the revaluation of Federal Reserve banks\u0027 gold certificates to reflect their fair market value.\n\nUnder the plan, within six months of enactment of the legislation, Federal Reserve banks would tender all of their oustanding gold certificates to the Treasury secretary. Within 90 days after that, the Treasury secretary would issue \"new gold certificates to the Federal Reserve banks that reflect the fair market value price of the gold.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve banks would then \"remit the difference in cash value between the old and new certificates\" to the Treasury secretary.\n\nRead More: Anthony Pompliano: Bitcoin Will Be on U.S. Balance Sheet in \u0027Next 10, 15 Years\u0027\n\nAs of July 24, Federal Reserve banks held \"gold stock\" valued at $11 billion, according to the central bank\u0027s most recent balance sheet update.\n\nThat valuation might be based on the official U.S. book value of $42.22 per troy ounce, which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York uses to value its gold.\n\nBut the market value of the gold is more than 50 times higher, with front-month futures contracts on the yellow metal trading around $2,400, based on MarketWatch pricing.\n\nRead more: Making Bitcoin a Strategic Reserve Asset Contradicts \u0027Freedom From Government\u0027 Narrative, Says WSJ\n\n",

    "content": "A brand-new meme coin that’s creating a huge buzz among investors is WienerAI ($WAI). It uniquely combines the fun of memes with the power of AI to create a personal trading companion.\n\n$WAI token presale has been a huge hit, with over $8 million raised in presale. Now, excitement is building rapidly about WienerAI’s upcoming launch on decentralized platforms (DEX) next month.\n\nWith under 24 hours left the presale left, investors are rushing to buy $WAI at a much lower price before the DEX listings.\n\nWienerAI ($WAI) aims to redefine the meme coin space by AI with the fun of memes. The platform has a catchy ‘sausage dog’ character that offers actual utility, unlike many meme coins that just ride on social media hype.\n\nIts main feature is its smart trading bot, which is easy for traders of any experience to use.\n\nYou can ask the bot questions in simple English, like “Which cryptos could grow 10x in the next month?” The bot will quickly analyze the market in real time and give you a list of possible good investments while explaining why it chose them.\n\nWhat’s unique about this bot is that talking to it feels like chatting with a friend, even when it’s explaining complicated market data.\n\n\n\nIt’s like having a personal trading assistant at your disposal 24/7.\n\nThis bot can then help you trade on DEXs without any additional fees. It even protects you from certain trading risks and makes your transactions safer.\n\nThis unique idea has caught a lot of investor interest, which is quite evident in WienerAI’s presale figures and milestones.\n\nIt’s worth noting that WienerAI gained over 16.2K followers on X (formerly Twitter) in just a few weeks of launch.\n\nThere are just under 24 hours left to buy $WAI tokens at the presale price of $0.00073 during WienerAI’s presale. This AI-powered meme coin has already raised over $8 million, showing that it has a lot of value beyond just its funny name.\n\n\n\nWienerAI is making final calibrations!\n\nThe presale ends in just 2 days. This is your last chance 🤖🚀 pic.twitter.com/ieHkhv4Bsk\n\n— WienerAI (@WienerDogAI) July 29, 2024\n\nNow is the last chance for people who want to invest early to buy $WAI tokens at a relatively cheap price. Just a $100 investment in $WAI could fetch you 136,986 tokens.\n\nYou can buy these tokens with USDT, ETH, BNB, or even credit cards.\n\nWienerAI also has a staking mechanism that lets presale investors stake their tokens and earn a very high annual yield of around 129% at press time.\n\nHowever, it’s important to remember that the rate will decrease as more tokens are staked. At the time of writing, over 8 billion $WAI tokens had already been staked.\n\nAs the presale comes to a close, investors are getting more and more excited about WienerAI’s August launch on the Uniswap DEX.\n\n\n\nWienerAI’s whitepaper highlights how 10% of the total supply is set aside for DEX trading. This can help keep prices stable after the coin is listed.\n\nWienerAI is already witnessing high investor traction even before its official platform launch.\n\nOver 13,000 people have joined its Telegram group, and many prominent publications, like The Economic Times, have also written about the project.\n\nMoreover, popular crypto analyst and YouTuber Michael Wrubel called WienerAI one of the “Top AI Meme Crypto For 2024.”\n\n\n\nIt’s no surprise that the presale crossed $8 million relatively quickly after witnessing huge community support.\n\nThis initial traction has set the stage for the meme coin’s exponential growth. In fact, WienerAI’s launch is also timed perfectly as AI coins are becoming more popular.\n\nAfter the developers can successfully add and launch the trade bot’s features, WienerAI might become one of the most popular trading bots on the market due to its user-friendly interface.\n\nEarly investors still have a chance to buy $WAI at a presale price in the next 24 hours before the upcoming DEX listing in August.\n\nVisit WienerAI Presale\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The technology, thanks to its decentralized structure, is more difficult to hack. Issues that need to be overcome include its energy consumption, relative lack of speed, and the fact that each block in the chain can hold only so much data.\n\nThe number of 401(k)s that have been forgotten, according to estimates from Capitalize.\n\n",
    "content": "Blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, could actually change the way we manage 401(k)s. Pundits claim blockchain represents the biggest breakthrough since the internet, with the potential to improve just about everything in our lives, including our health and bank balance. Here\u0027s how it might also increase the amount of money we have to live on in retirement.\n\nWhat Is Blockchain?\n\nIf you\u0027ve kept up to date with the latest financial and investment innovations, you\u0027ve probably heard of blockchain. It is a digital ledger that records anything that needs to be logged and verified as having taken place securely and simultaneously across a network of computers. Every time something new happens, a record is automatically added to this type of online Excel document. That record is safe, cannot be tampered with, and is theoretically accessible to everyone.\n\nIn short, this technology offers a much more potentially secure, trustworthy, efficient, and organized way to record data than we currently have. While that might not sound particularly special, it is actually a pretty big deal.\n\nWhat Impact Can Blockchain Have on 401(k)s?\n\nOne thing that could really do with being saved by a technological breakthrough is the U.S. retirement system. Increasing life expectancy, mismanagement, low mobility, a lack of trust, too many stakeholders, and limited transparency are just a few of the issues that threaten to leave a significant portion of the population without the resources to live comfortably when they leave the workforce.\n\nBlockchain, if it lives up to its potential, could help to reduce these headwinds and breathe life back into retirement savings. Below we list some of the key ways that this highly hyped technology might make one of the darkest clouds hanging over the economy go away.\n\nFaith in the financial institutions that manage retirement plans isn’t exactly soaring and part of that is due to a lack of transparency. Inconsistent information, hidden charges, and the use of jargon cause many people to put off saving for retirement.\n\nA shared decentralized ledger could perhaps help to remedy this problem. Having everything stored in one easy-to-access place would give Americans a clearer picture of their retirement assets and perhaps incentivize them to invest more. A better-informed population would also be more likely to make smarter investment decisions and not just go with the default option.\n\nThese days people have a tendency to change jobs fairly frequently. In some cases, when they leave a job, they also leave an old pension behind.\n\nIn the U.S., it is basically up to employees to keep tabs on all their 401(k)s from previous jobs or merge them into their new employer’s plans. There is no pension database that keeps track of workers’ total defined contributions or someone who takes care of making sure retirement savings move where the employee goes.\n\nSadly, this means it is quite common for people to lose track of where all their retirement accounts are held and forfeit some of the money they worked hard to put aside for their later years. In 2017, NBC News reported that American workers could be losing a collective $2 trillion in retirement savings simply by failing to roll over their 401(k) savings accounts when they change jobs. In 2021, the financial services company Capitalize said there were 24.3 million forgotten 401(k) accounts worth about 20% of all 401(k) assets in the U.S.\n\nBlockchain could put an end to this. With this technology, it would be possible to keep track of all of our retirement accounts in one easy-to-access place.\n\nOne of the most hyped things about blockchain is that it doesn’t require a third-party intermediary such as banks and clearinghouses to validate transactions. When money or something else changes hands, it instantaneously gets logged on multiple computers that in theory are accessible for all to see.\n\nThe significance of this is huge. Cutting out the middlemen should trigger faster results and lower costs. With fewer people taking a cut, more of your money is invested, resulting in a bigger pension pot.\n\nHaving all your information related to retirement savings stored in one easy-to-access location should arguably put pressure on financial institutions to work harder to retain clients. A common problem today is that retirement plans are seldom monitored by their owners. Should blockchain live up to its promise and change this, asset managers will no longer be able to take customers for granted. When the threat of them shopping around, jumping ship, and demanding more becomes reality, providers will, in theory, be forced to offer more competitive terms, hopefully resulting in lower costs and higher quality products.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a spike in the number of 401(k)s that have been hacked. Most attacks lead to personal information being stolen, although online criminals are now increasingly taking money from people’s plans, too.\n\nBlockchain could help put an end to this. Information on the blockchain network is located in a shared database that exists on millions of computers rather than in one central location. According to experts in the field, that decentralized structure makes it more difficult to hack.\n\nHurdles Still to Overcome\n\nThe benefits of blockchain have been touted for several years now, yet the technology has still not been widely adopted. Why is that? As we’ve seen with other big breakthroughs in the past, it takes time for a potentially game-changing invention to be transformed into a system that can be safely and efficiently used by the masses.\n\nIn 2017, the research firm Gartner predicted that blockchain was still 10 years away from going mainstream. It said five to 10 years in 2019, indicating we still have a way to go before this technology is tried, tested, and ready to become part of our everyday lives.\n\nSome of the biggest issues that need to be ironed out before blockchain can feasibly become scalable for widespread use include the amount of energy it consumes to function, its relative lack of speed, and the fact that each block in the chain can only hold so much data.\n\nAnother concern is that uniting 401(k)s with blockchain could lead cryptocurrencies to become a permanent fixture in retirement plans. The U.S. Department of Labor, the body in charge of making sure that employer retirement accounts meet the minimum standards set by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), has made it fairly clear that it’s against this idea due to the speculative and volatile nature of these digital currencies.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlockchain has the potential to vastly improve the living standards of the retired portion of the population. Greater transparency and efficiency should boost engagement, lower costs, and ensure the money we put aside each month is put to its best use and given the greatest chance to grow in value.\n\nThe bad news is it could take a while for that exciting prospect to become reality. As things stand, blockchain still has plenty of hurdles to overcome before becoming ready for the mainstream. There’s also a chance that it will never make it that far and be superseded by something else, as yet unknown, that is even more capable.\n\n",

    "content": "After over a decade of suspense, creditors of the defunct Mt. Gox Bitcoin (BTC) exchange have finally begun receiving long-awaited payouts this month. Data from research firm Glassnode shows that as of Tuesday, 59,000 of Mt. Gox’s 142,000 BTC had already been distributed to creditors via the Kraken and Bitstamp exchanges, with another 79,600 BTC to follow soon.\n\nAccording to a recent report by Glassnode, the total recovered coin volume amounts to over 141,686 BTC, with nearly 59,000 BTC already finding their way to creditors and the remaining sum awaiting distribution.\n\nKraken and Bitstamp have been entrusted as one of the five designated exchanges responsible for managing and disbursing these funds. Kraken has received 49,000 BTC and Bitstamp the initial tranche of 10,000 BTC.\n\nNotably, the firm noted that the size of these distributions already surpasses recent significant transactions in the cryptocurrency space, including crypto ETF inflows, issuance to miners, and the massive selling pressure experienced by the German government between June and July.\n\nHowever, creditors opted to receive BTC rather than fiat currency, which was a new option under the Japanese bankruptcy law, suggesting that many of the creditors remain active in the Bitcoin space, despite the extensive legal process.\n\nThis active participation may indicate that only a subset of the distributed coins will enter the market for sale, according to Glassnode’s analysis, which may indicate a long-term holding strategy among creditors. This ultimately supports BTC’s price rather than having an impact that could result in further price declines for the largest cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nAdditionally, an analysis of the spot cumulative volume delta (CVD) metric on Kraken and Bitstamp shows only a marginal uptick in sell-side pressure, suggesting creditors may be more inclined to hold onto their BTC for the long term.\n\nAlso supporting Bitcoin’s price over the past month, which has rebounded nearly 25% after hitting a 6-month low of $53,500 on July 5. Long-term holders of the largest cryptocurrency on the market have been on a buying spree, according to market expert Ali Martinez, who recently revealed that these investors have added over 110,000 BTC to their portfolios.\n\nSimilarly, the Bitcoin ETF market has had its share of the recent recovery seen in BTC’s price over the past month, with the latest data showing further inflows into the regulated market in the US.\n\nAccording to SoSo Value data, Bitcoin ETFs in the US saw a total of $124 million in new inflows on Monday, although Grayscale’s GBTC ETF saw outflows of about $54 million. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF had the most inflows for the day, with $206 million.\n\nAll this has contributed to BTC’s price consolidation between $65,000 and $68,000 over the past few days, with an eye on a potential retest of the all-time high of $73,500 reached in March this year.\n\nCurrently, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $66,000, down 2.5% over the past 24 hours and 1.5% over the past week.\n\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com\n\n",

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic increased the pace of digital transformation in all industries, with the financial services industry being on top. The growing use of fintech apps proves the significance of digital transformation in the domain of finance. With the power of technologies such as blockchain, cloud computing, and AI, fintech has changed the traditional perspectives on finance. AI and fintech can shape the future of the financial industry with innovation.\n\nTherefore, the applications of AI in fintech have attracted the attention of big players and startups offering financial services. Interestingly, around 90% of fintech companies use AI in some form. What are the different ways in which fintech companies can use artificial intelligence? Let us find out more about the different fintech AI applications, the benefits of AI in fintech, and examples of fintech startups that have embraced AI.\n\n\n\nBefore you find out more about the top fintech AI applications, it is important to identify the reasons for embracing AI in fintech. Artificial intelligence can offer a wide range of advantages for companies and customers in the fintech space. Here are the notable advantages of bringing AI into the world of fintech.\n\nAI has the capability to process massive collections of financial datasets in real-time. In addition, the power of analytics with AI also helps ensure strategic decision-making. The insights by AI can help fintech companies with identification of potential risks and offering personalized financial advice to consumers. AI also offers support for data mining to develop an in-depth understanding of customer behavior and ensure optimization of services.\n\nArtificial intelligence can also enhance fintech through better risk management.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain may be the most important invention since the internet.\n\nLike many other top inventions, blockchain has more than one application or use case. Blockchain uses are being developed in the financial and healthcare industries, government, supply chains, and more. Many popular blockchains are slower than traditional financial systems; however, blockchain developers are working to increase speeds.\n\nDivision of information and how it is often channeled creates silos within governments, increasing inefficiency. Blockchain can solve this issue by securely distributing information to reach those who need it more quickly.\n\n",
    "content": "World-changing inventions like the printing press, the radio, and the internet opened new ways for people to communicate and share knowledge. In many cases, blockchain technology expands on these inventions. Blockchain provides a method to secure and distribute knowledge, data, and information so that it can be shared without alteration, interference, or be controlled.\n\nAlthough many contenders exist for the most important inventions, some people believe blockchain ranks among them. Read on to learn why blockchain might be one of the more important inventions of the early twenty-first century.\n\nBlockchain in Finance\n\nMoney does make the world go \u0027round, but there are also many issues surrounding its use. Here are some of the ways blockchain can be used in the financial industry.\n\nIt is natural for people to want as much money as possible, but with that desire comes the drive to get it in any way possible—many people resort to illegal or unethical means to fulfill their dreams of wealth.\n\nThe finance industry is teeming with temptations—money flows in and out of homes, businesses, and countries, and there never seems to be enough. There is so much capital circulating that it needs to be managed in a way that removes the temptation to act unethically.\n\nBlockchain can solve corruption issues within financial systems by eliminating the risk of duplicating or double-spending assets. Transactions are initiated, executed, recorded, encrypted, verified, and stored by nodes who manage \"an irreversible ledger of transactions\" and must reach a consensus to approve a new block—making it the perfect solution.\n\nThe primary reason behind creating blockchain and cryptocurrency was to create a decentralized method of exchanging value; in other words, transferring money to someone for services provided or goods received.\n\nTherefore, it can eliminate third parties like banks, payment processors, payment gateways, settlement banks, and other financial entities within our bloated and costly financial systems. Blockchain also allows people who do not have access to financial instruments like loans or other services to access them.\n\nCryptocurrency can be used if financial systems collapse. For example, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2021 and 2022, cryptocurrency became a major source of funding for the Ukrainians and the government—it recognized cryptocurrency as a legal means of payment in 2021.\n\nCryptocurrency was created using blockchain technology, but an unforeseen consequence of introducing cryptocurrency was that because it held exchangeable value, its value could fluctuate. People started paying for it, demand increased, prices rose, and investors saw an opportunity.\n\nCryptocurrencies are now widely purchased by investors as investments. It is also used by traders to make profits from price movements.\n\nBlockchain is revolutionizing banking and lending. Not only is it creating ways for consumers to lend to each other, but crypto lending companies have emerged that use blockchain in their loan approval process at significantly reduced costs. Costs are reduced because there are no lawyers, banks, paperwork, or other lengthy procedures.\n\nInsurance providers are exploring ways to implement blockchain into their systems and products. For example, insurance providers could collect information through blockchains to customize insurance products and reduce instances of fraud.\n\nBlockchains could be used to securely store client health information, uploaded whenever a patient is seen. The blockchain could send requests to insurance through smart contracts, which in turn, could instantly approve or disapprove care and transfer funds.\n\nOther insurance processes could also be streamlined, from finding coverage that meets your needs to filing claims and receiving payments.\n\nBlockchain and Government\n\nSome critical issues regarding government processes and infrastructure are inefficiency, corruption, fraud, waste, lack of trust, security, and siloing. Blockchain has the potential to reduce all of these issues significantly.\n\nGovernment silos are concentrations of information, resources, and decision-making. Critical information that is not shared keeps policy-makers and regulators from making the most informed decisions possible.\n\nResources can be properly tracked, accounted for, and transferred if needed. Data about businesses and citizens can be better secured, and payroll taxes can be collected more efficiently. Additionally, banks could settle intrabank loans in real-time rather than waiting for the end of the day, increasing transaction volume and making banking more efficient.\n\nWhen information is secured and distributed, it cannot be changed or withheld for the benefit of one party or another. Spending can be falsely reported; sometimes, money can disappear without a trace. Using blockchain, government funds can be tracked, and entities can be held accountable for spending.\n\nBlockchain Tech In Healthcare\n\nHealthcare is an industry that can significantly benefit from blockchain. As a secure method of sharing and storing information, blockchain technology cannot directly improve human health, but it can improve the systems used to share medical knowledge and information.\n\nIf blockchain could be integrated into the healthcare system, as some projects are aiming to accomplish, the technology could help improve lives and treatment plans.\n\nBlockchain and the Supply Chain\n\nBlockchain technology can also be used to track the movement of goods. For example, several companies are using distributed ledgers to track perishable goods while keeping track of essential variables like moisture and temperature.\n\nA critical concern in supply chain management is efficiency. Supply chains are vast networks of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. Blockchain provides a method to track raw materials, sourcing, production methods, transportation times, payments, and many other supply chain activities that can create inefficiencies or issues.\n\nConcerns About Blockchain Technology\n\nEnthusiasm for blockchain technology is still far from universal. Many enterprises have been using the distributed ledger technology that blockchain evolved from for many years in permissioned environments. The key difference between the two is that blockchain uses programming to reach a consensus about the state of the distributed ledger.\n\nTo come to a consensual agreement about a massive ledger\u0027s state, database researchers and scientists created consensus mechanisms that use encryption methods for proof of transactions on the ledger. One such mechanism is proof-of-work, which requires large amounts of energy because of its competitive rewards nature.\n\nMany blockchains are also slower than centralized systems, with transactions confirmations times between dozens per second to thousands per second. When compared to modern financial systems that confirm tens of thousands of transactions per second, blockchains have been lagging behind—however, many developers are working to increase transactions speeds throughout the networks.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nMany of the most influential inventions of all time have a broad range of applications. The internet is one of the most recent that has impacted virtually every area of business and personal life since it came into common use in the 1990s. Blockchain, a newcomer, offers as many endless applications as the internet and other inventions proceeding it.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

    "summary": "The World Bank has called for the creation of a blockchain-based bond.\n\nIn August 2018, the World Bank created the bond-i, the world\u0027s first global bond using distributed ledger technology. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia arranged the blockchain bond issue, which initially raised A$110 million and a subsequent A$50 million during a second tranche offering. Financial institutions are beginning to look to the power of blockchain technology for the management, creation, and oversight of various debt instruments. A benefit of blockchain-based bonds is the ability to assist capital markets in achieving fast, efficient, and secure transactions via distributed ledger technologies.\n\nThe World Bank raises on average between $55 billion and $65 billion each year by issuing bonds.\n\n",
    "content": "Some of the most important and influential financial institutions worldwide may be looking to further integrate blockchain technology into their offerings, including the creation of blockchain-based bonds. For an example of how to accomplish this, they might look to one of the world\u0027s largest lenders to developing countries, the World Bank.\n\nIn August 2018, the World Bank launched its bond-i, short for \"blockchain operated new debt instrument.\" The new bond was created through Australia\u0027s Commonwealth Bank (CBA). Below, we\u0027ll discuss how blockchain-based bonds work and take a look at how these bonds could impact the mainstream investment world.\n\nBond-i Details\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the bond-i is the world\u0027s first bond to be \"created, allocated, transferred, and managed through its life cycle using distributed ledger technology.\" The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) was the arranger for the bond issue, which raised A$110 million. The maturity date for the two-year bond was Aug. 28, 2020. Coupon payments were paid semi-annually in arrears at an annual rate of 2.2%.\n\nThe bond-i was the culmination of research performed by the World Bank\u0027s Blockchain Innovation Lab. Launched in June 2017, the lab\u0027s research is part of the World Bank\u0027s strategy to study the impact of disruptive technologies (such as blockchain) on global economies and harness its potential for development. The CBA Blockchain Centre of Excellence developed and built the bond-i blockchain platform.\n\nIn May 2019, the World Bank and CBA announced they had successfully added to their platform\u0027s capability by enabling secondary bond trading recorded on blockchain. The goal was to assist capital markets in achieving fast, efficient, and secure transactions via distributed ledger technologies. In August 2019, the World Bank reported it had issued a second tranche of its blockchain bond, raising an additional A$50 million.\n\nIt\u0027s important to note that while bond-i is the first bond issued through blockchain, it is not the only debt instrument to do so. The Spanish banking group BBVA signed a €150 million blockchain-based loan in November 2018.\n\nEthereum Blockchain Is Integral\n\nA private Ethereum blockchain is set up to allow for the management of blockchain bonds. This blockchain network also creates bond-i products. According to the World Bank, the platform has been reviewed by Microsoft to ensure that architecture, security, and functionality are solid. The CBA development team partnered with a law firm to plan for the issuance of bonds and to develop the smart contracts which govern bond-i products.\n\nIndependent blockchain developer Matthew Di Ferrante, who has previously worked for the Ethereum Foundation, indicated that the move is a \"good first example\" of how blockchain can be integrated into the bond world. He adds that \"financial instruments like bonds are easily ported to blockchains/smart contracts, but it\u0027s not the be-all and end-all even for mainstream financial institutions. The real usefulness will come when many different institutions and industries are all using compatible blockchains\" (emphasis in original).\n\nImplications of the Project\n\nWhile the bonds issued as part of this project may be fairly standard, the implications of the project are not. First, there is the question of decentralization. For much of the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries, decentralization is a crucial and central tenet. Necessarily, a private blockchain with the World Bank co-managing is not nearly as decentralized as many blockchain projects are.\n\nFurther, while this bond project harnessed blockchain technology for management, creation, and oversight, it was essentially entirely unrelated to cryptocurrency. Some might see this as a confirmation that mainstream financial institutions are happy to separate out cryptocurrencies from blockchain technology, preferring to only utilize the latter as they ignore the former.\n\nWhile the World Bank\u0027s bondi-i was not the first time that major financial institutions have looked toward blockchain technology in various ways, it does have the potential to influence other institutions which may have previously been hesitant. Undoubtedly, the perceived success or failure of the bond-i program will impact other financial institutions\u0027 decision to explore this space as well.\n\n",

    "summary": "Learn how to mint your own NFT via three different methods: Using OpenSea, writing your own smart contract, and via Etherscan.\n\n",
    "content": "NFTs are fast becoming a vital type of digital asset. The rise in their popularity signals that blockchains are moving beyond cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, governance tokens, and utility tokens to break into today’s cultural zeitgeist—with these unique digital collectibles seeing growing adoption across media, entertainment, music, sports, and more.\n\nWhether you’re a creator looking for new ways to monetize your creativity using cutting-edge technology or a pioneering collector breaking into Web3 for the first time, this simple, step-by-step tutorial teaches you how to mint (create) your first NFT.\n\nTo follow along with this tutorial, you should already be familiar with the MetaMask (or any other OpenSea-compatible) wallet.\n\nBefore looking into how to create an NFT, it’s essential to understand exactly what an NFT is. NFTs are non-fungible, or unique, tokens, which means that no two NFTs are ever the same, even if they might look the same. This is because each NFT has a unique identifier. You can think of this like a barcode. Even if the same image is attached to two different NFTs, you’ll be able to tell the difference by their barcodes.\n\nThis is also what makes NFT extremely powerful for creators. In the past, you could copy digital art endlessly, and there was no way to tell one file from the other. Now there is—and that’s just scratching the surface of what makes NFTs a paradigm-shifting technology.\n\nTo dive deeper into the technical aspects of NFTs and what they can do, check out What Is an NFT?Minting an NFT means creating a unique token on a blockchain. Only after minting an NFT is the digital collectible stored on the blockchain.\n\nIt’s important to know what is being stored during the minting process. It could be an entire work of art, in which case the entirety of the NFT and its metadata is stored “on-chain,” or it could be a reference to information stored off-chain using a tool like IPFS. Regardless of the data being stored, the simplest way to think about minting is as the process of creating an NFT.\n\nSo you’ve decided you’d like to mint your first NFT. How do you get started? You could use an NFT marketplace like OpenSea or mint directly onto the blockchain via a smart contract. Let’s take a look at both methods.\n\nMinting an NFT on OpenSea is straightforward. It consists of two steps.\n\nNote, if you don’t have a collection, you may need to create that first. There are instructions in the “Collection” section to help.\n\nIf you want a more programmatic approach to minting NFTs, deploying a smart contract to a blockchain like Ethereum could be a better option.\n\nIf you come across a contract for an NFT project and want to mint directly from a tool like Etherscan, you can do that if the contract has been verified. The checkmark next to “Contract” is the first thing to look for. This means the contract is verified.\n\nIf the contract has been verified, you should be able to interact with it from Etherscan directly.\n\nYou’ll need to select “Contract” then “Write Contract.” Once there, you should see the functions you can interact with. You’ll be looking for the mint function; it might be named safeMint. After you connect your wallet and provide your address, you should be able to mint the NFT to your wallet. Follow along with the GIF below to get started.\n\nBuilding smart contracts to mint NFTs is a more in-depth topic. The tutorials below will walk you through the various processes.\n\nThe cost of minting an NFT depends on the method you use and the state of the network at the time you’re minting. If cost is a concern, NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea have a “lazy minting” function, which enables you to sell an NFT before it’s minted—with the buyer paying the cost.\n\nSelling an NFT is simple if you use an NFT marketplace. For example, OpenSea, Nifty GateWay, Rarible, SuperRare, and X2Y2 are all prominent NFT marketplaces many NFT creators use to sell NFTs.\n\nThe NFT minting process is very similar for other blockchains if you mint an NFT through marketplaces like OpenSea. However, there may be blockchains that are not supported by a specific marketplace. A good place to find more information on which blockchains are supported is a marketplace’s help page.\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about building a successful NFT project, check out this guide, which details the essential steps and considerations for getting your project off the ground—NFT projects are more than the code behind the images.\n\nTo learn more, visit chain.link, subscribe to the Chainlink newsletter, and follow Chainlink on Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit.\n\n",

    "content": "Decentralized Exchanges or DEXs have emerged as the most powerful platforms in the web3 ecosystem with enhancements over traditional exchanges. DEXs have provided a new perspective on the approaches we follow to trade digital assets. As compared to the traditional centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges work without central authorities. Therefore, decentralized exchange development guide brings additional advantages to users such as improved control over assets, enhanced privacy and better security. Decentralized exchanges are one of the formidable elements in the continuously evolving web3 ecosystem. As a matter of fact, the daily trading volume on DEXs in October 2023 surpassed $1.3 billion. Over 209 million users performed financial transactions on decentralized exchanges, with Uniswap being the largest in the pack. Let us find how to build a decentralized exchange like Uniswap with insights into important requirements for creating DEXs.\n\n\n\nDecentralized exchanges or DEXs differ from centralized exchanges, such as Binance or Coinbase, which serve as intermediaries or centralized authority in different operations. The understanding of DEX fundamentals is essential in a decentralized exchange development guide as it can help you find explanation for its importance. Users deposit assets in centralized exchanges which look for matching buy and sell orders to conduct transactions. As a result, centralized exchanges gain control of user funds in every transaction.\n\nOn the other hand, decentralized exchanges such as SushiSwap and Uniswap follow a completely different approach. For example, DEXs use smart contracts to enable token swaps and users can connect their crypto wallets directly to these exchanges for direct trade with other users. At the same time, it is also important to note that DEXs also bring some challenges alongside the benefits of decentralization. For example, users would come across concerns of limited liquidity for less popular tokens. On the other hand, DEXs have become popular additions to the web3 ecosystem for offering better security and enhanced user control in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nLearn about the working mechanisms and advantages of smart contracts with Blockchains Fundamentals Free Course.\n\nDecentralized exchanges have gained momentum in the web3 ecosystem for diverse reasons. The popularity of decentralized exchange software and protocols can be attributed to the setbacks with centralized exchanges. Cryptocurrency exchanges gained attention worldwide for offering flexible means to interact with cryptocurrencies. Within no time, centralized crypto exchanges became one of the most popular and commonly used tools in web3. Big players in the domain of cryptocurrency exchanges gained unprecedented growth in popularity albeit with significant challenges. For example, cryptocurrency exchanges became increasingly vulnerable to social engineering attacks and emerged as popular sites for promoting rug and pull scams.\n\nExamples of the downfall of popular centralized crypto exchanges such as FTX prove that decentralized exchange development guide is an essential requirement. The collapse of FTX crypto exchange in 2022 not only provided a reason to create DEX exchange but also showed that DEXs can revolutionize accessibility of cryptocurrencies. Decentralized exchanges offer better security and transparency with special emphasis on privacy and safety of user data and assets.\n\nExcited to know the use cases of crypto in NFTs, DeFi, and the metaverse, Enroll now in the Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Course\n\nThe setbacks with centralized cryptocurrency exchanges serve as the ideal reasons to build a decentralized exchange with features to address the limitations of centralized exchanges. You can notice the following factors as the best reasons to encourage businesses to build their own decentralized exchange. Here are some of the most prominent reasons for which you should develop decentralized exchanges.\n\nOne of the foremost reasons to invest your efforts and resources in building a decentralized exchange is accessibility. DEXs change the conventional definitions of accessibility to crypto exchanges by ensuring 24/7 availability. Decentralized exchanges attract a diverse range of investors and traders who can access the platforms round-the-clock with a stable internet connection. If you study the example of decentralized exchange, you are likely to come across multiple token pairs, which can address the needs of experienced traders as well as beginners. Decentralized exchanges also offer the assurance of better global reach with the flexibility for managing cross-border transactions.\n\nThe continuous expansion of the web3 and blockchain ecosystem also presents another convincing reason to pursue DEX development projects. Businesses can stay on top of latest developments and trends in web3 to exhibit readiness for the future by creating their own decentralized exchanges.\n\nAnother important highlight that separates DEXs from other crypto exchanges is the assurance of community development. The examples of successful decentralized exchanges shows that they can develop strong communities of crypto token holders and users. The communities can serve as a valuable asset for businesses developing DEXs as they can support the introduction of new projects.\n\nBusinesses should also seek answers for “How to build a DEX exchange?” as DEXs can open new opportunities for revenue. DEXs can rely on trading fees as the primary source of income, which are derived from the shares of transaction amount paid by users for transactions on the platform. On top of it, decentralized exchanges also charge token listing fees that can help businesses earn revenue. The fees are applicable for cryptocurrency projects which want to list their tokens on the decentralized exchange.\n\nIn some cases where DEX has its own DAO, users can participate in the governance process of the DEX. Therefore, it can open revenue generation streams through sales of governance tokens. In addition, DEXs can also look for opportunities to collaborate with other web3 projects and raise money from advertising. Businesses can also opt for addition of premium features as another method of generating profits from new decentralized exchanges. For example, DEXs can ensure monetization of services through advanced trading analytics alongside customization options such as personalized alerts and dashboards.\n\nThe list of advantages of decentralized exchange development guide for businesses also focuses on transparency. DEX transactions are documented on blockchain networks and users have the flexibility for fair and secure verification of all operations on the platform. The assurance of better transparency helps in encouraging trust alongside improving the possibilities for repeated use of decentralized exchanges.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nBusinesses searching for prospects to build a decentralized exchange must think about the two prominent variants of DEXs. You can find two primary variants of DEXs, depending on the extent of decentralization. Completely decentralized and semi-decentralized DEXs are different from each other in the extent of control over user assets and transactions.\n\nIn the case of completely decentralized DEXs, you would find that there are no central authorities or intermediaries running operations. Users have complete control over their assets and private keys. Upon initiation of a trade, it is conducted directly between users by leveraging smart contracts. With the assurance of decentralization, completely decentralized DEXs can improve privacy and security.\n\nOn the other hand, semi-decentralized DEXs bring a different angle to example of decentralized exchange functionalities. Semi-decentralized exchanges facilitate an effective balance between user experience and decentralization. You can find features similar to centralized exchanges on these DEXs, such as order matching. However, semi-decentralized exchanges also provide complete control to users over their assets. Semi-decentralized exchanges work with the combination of on-chain and off-chain elements, which are tailored for achieving desired speed and efficiency, alongside delivering the essential security benefits.\n\nDecentralized crypto exchanges are a valuable resource in the web3 ecosystem with a broad range of advantages. However, creating a decentralized exchange software involves emphasis on the balance between user experience, security and trustless environments. At the same time, each trait presents unique challenges in the process of developing DEXs. Therefore, it is important to rely on continuous innovation and adaptability to new trends and requirements. It is also important to note that DEXs evolve continuously with developers working on addressing the challenges with user experience, security and trust.\n\nHow can you identify the important components for your DEX? In such cases, you can rely on examples of popular DEXs, such as Uniswap, and their architecture to identify components. Here is an outline of the most important components you need to develop decentralized exchanges.\n\nEvery decentralized exchange development guide showcases the importance of smart contracts in developing DEXs. Smart contracts serve as the driving force behind DEXs and support the management of crypto assets without centralized intermediaries. Uniswap works by using a collection of immutable smart contracts which ensures safety of contract logic against malicious manipulation.\n\nCurious to understand the complete smart contract development lifecycle? Enroll now in the Smart Contracts Development Course!\n\nAnother important component of DEXs are liquidity pools, which allow users to deposit their crypto assets in return for earning interest. Contribution of more assets to the pools helps in improving their liquidity. Users who deposit their tokens in liquidity pools, or liquidity providers, can receive a portion of the trading fees generated by the DEX as rewards for facilitating liquidity.\n\nWallets are also an important requirement when you create DEX exchange and you can choose different types of wallets according to your choice. Uniswap offers compatibility with a broad range of wallets, such as Metamask and its native Uniswap wallet.\n\nIf you want to have a successful DEX, then you must incorporate safety mechanisms to protect your DEX against security threats and smart contract vulnerabilities. For example, smart contract audits by third-party vendors can help in identifying potential vulnerabilities in the code before it goes live.\n\nThe most crucial highlight in the answers for “How to build a DEX exchange?” also draw the limelight on operating mechanism or the mechanism used in a DEX for matching orders. While you can opt for on-chain order books and off-chain order registers, the ideal choice of order matching mechanism is Automated Market Maker or AMM systems.\n\n\n\nWith clarity on what you should build to get the best results from a decentralized exchange, you must explore the steps that can help you create a DEX. Here are some of the recommended steps to develop your decentralized exchange.\n\nYou can begin a DEX development project only after establishing your business goals and what you want to achieve with the DEX. At this stage, you must define the monetization strategy, features, target audience and type of assets for the DEX.\n\nEthereum might appear as the obvious choice for developing a decentralized exchange. However, you can explore new alternatives such as Solana and Polygon to capitalize on advantages of cost-efficiency and speed.\n\nExcited to learn about the fundamentals of Solana and Solana smart contracts development, Enroll now in the Solana Development Course.\n\nThe most important requirement to build a decentralized exchange is the order matching mechanism. You can opt for Automated Market Makers or order books, according to your preferences and objectives.\n\nYou have to develop smart contracts for managing the trading process. In addition, you must also create smart contracts for calculation and distribution of trading fees and rewards. It is important to emphasize security above everything else in the smart contract development process.\n\nAnother crucial step in the process of creating decentralized exchanges is UI/UX design. You must develop decentralized exchange software which helps users discover the important functions without any conflicts.\n\nDEX developers must also pay attention to compliance with legal regulations for cryptocurrencies and related financial services. It is also important to check for licensing and registration requirements for DEXs to operate in specific jurisdictions.\n\nTake any example of decentralized exchange which has tasted success and you would notice how they prioritize security above all. You should also implement strong security measures for your DEX to ensure safeguards for user assets. For example, encryption of sensitive user data and interactions or regular security audits of the DEX architecture.\n\nCreate new, high-level, innovative blockchain solutions for different industries as a highly-skilled blockchain developer with Blockchain Developer Career Path.\n\nThe utility of decentralized exchanges serves a new benchmark for usability and decentralization in the web3 ecosystem. With DEXs, users can enjoy unprecedented levels of freedom regarding all actions with their assets.

Over the course of the last decade, IoT has led to significant changes in the approaches for business operations and personal tasks in people’s everyday lives. At the same time, AI has emerged as a formidable force for transformation in the domain of technology.\n\nTherefore, discussions about artificial intelligence of things AIoT have been gaining momentum. The convergence of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things leads to the formation of AIoT. However, it is also important to note that people are likely to be curious about the ways in which AI and IoT can complement each other. Let us learn more about the working mechanism of AIoT and its benefits and applications in the real world.\n\n\n\nThe best approach to understanding the significance of artificial intelligence of things involves unraveling its definition. You can find better explanations for queries like “What is the artificial intelligence of things?” by identifying the advantages of its integral components, AI and IoT. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a crucial discipline in computer science that focuses on developing smart systems capable of simulating human intelligence.\n\nAI can empower machines to perform tasks like humans, such as understanding, perception, and reasoning. Internet of Things or IoT refers to a network of connected devices or objects capable of real-time data collection and transfer through sensors or software.\n\nWith artificial intelligence of things, you can combine the powers of AI and IoT. As a result, AIoT can help in creating new systems that can leverage AI capabilities for processing the data collected and generated by IoT systems. The power of AIoT applications revolves around combining machine learning models with connectivity and data transfer features with IoT. By incorporating AI in IoT systems, the systems would no longer work only on collection and transfer of data. IoT systems can leverage the capabilities of AI for in-depth understanding and analysis of the data they collect and generate.\n\nWant to understand the fundamentals of the Internet of Things (IoT)? Enroll now in the IoT Fundamentals Course!\n\nThe next important aspect of any guide to artificial intelligence of things is the overview of its working mechanism. Most of the artificial intelligence of things examples prove that AIoT devices work by embedding AI in infrastructure components. The infrastructure components, including chipsets and programs, are connected to each other in IoT networks.\n\nOn top of that, AIoT systems utilize APIs to ensure seamless operation and communication between hardware, platform components, and software. Upon becoming operational, IoT devices would collect data, and AI would analyze the data to extract valuable insights. The workings of AIoT also draw attention to the two common approaches for setting up AIoT systems. Here is an overview of the two prominent implementations of AIoT systems.\n\nThe first AIoT example that you must consider to understand the workings of artificial intelligence of things is cloud-based AIoT. Cloud-based IoT involves collection and processing of data from IoT devices through cloud computing platforms. It is important to connect IoT devices to the cloud as it serves as the ideal place for storing, processing, and accessing data for different applications and services.\n\nThe four important layers in cloud-based AIoT systems include device layer, connectivity layer, user communication layer, and cloud layer. With the device layer, you can find different types of hardware, such as beacons, cars, sensors, embedded devices, and tags. The infrastructure for artificial intelligence of things AIoT for cloud-based AIoT also includes the connectivity layer with fields and cloud gateways. It serves an important role in connecting cloud storage to controllers, intelligent devices, and sensors.\n\nThe cloud layer also plays a vital role in empowering cloud-based AIoT as it ensures data processing through components such as AI engine, data visualization, API data access, data storage, and analytics. On the other hand, the user communication layer primarily includes mobile applications and web portals.\n\nAnother popular implementation of AIoT systems that has gained attention of tech experts is edge-based AIoT. Your search for answers to “What is the artificial intelligence of things?” would also point you in the direction of edge-based AIoT for its special capabilities. Such types of AIoT implementations facilitate processing of IoT data at the edge or within proximity of the IoT devices. Therefore, edge-based AIoT systems require lower bandwidth for data transfers, thereby avoiding potential delays in data analysis.\n\nEdge-based AIoT systems include three prominent layers: collection terminal layer, connectivity layer, and edge layer. Each layer in edge-based AIoT applications serves a distinct functionality. For example, the collection terminal layer includes all the hardware devices, such as cars, sensors, embedded devices, tags, and mobility devices. The hardware devices in this layer are connected to the gateway through existing power lines.\n\nOn top of it, the connectivity layer includes field gateways that are connected to the collection terminal layer across the existing power lines. Finally, the edge layer in edge-based AIoT systems offers the facilities for effective data storage, processing, and generation of insights.\n\nUnderstand the actual potential of AI and the best practices for using AI tools with the AI For Business Course.\n\nA closer look at the artificial intelligence of things examples reveals that you can make the most of the best features of AI and IoT with AIoT systems. It is important to understand the different ways in which artificial intelligence and IoT can work together. Some of you may have doubts regarding the possibility of AI and IoT working together when they are distinct technologies. AI and IoT have been making significant technical developments and serving as valuable tools for technological development across different industries.\n\nThe combination of AI and IoT ensures that IoT devices can expand their utility beyond collecting and delivering data. IoT devices would develop the capabilities for better understanding and evaluation of data. Businesses, economies, and industries all over the world must take note of the advantages of AIoT.\n\nAIoT can help businesses achieve better operational efficiency. The combination of AI and IoT can help generate operational insights at a faster pace, thereby ensuring faster detection and resolution of problems. As a result, AIoT systems can also play a major role in improving operational efficiency for industrial automation tasks. For example, AIoT applications with cameras can help in quality control for industrial automation. On top of it, AIoT also ensures effective tracking and compliance with specific regulations and guidelines.\n\nAIoT devices can also have a significant influence on the reduction of operational costs. Smart systems with the power of AI and IoT can ensure efficient use of resources. For example, smart building applications can help in adjustment of temperature and light controls according to occupancy.\n\nTherefore, AIoT systems can play a vital role in improving machinery analysis and preventive maintenance in factors. Sensors and cameras can monitor machine parts and identify the ideal time to introduce improvements or implement maintenance schedules.\n\nBusinesses across different industries have to struggle with risk management problems. Intelligent, distributed systems based on AIoT can predict future risks alongside suggesting preventive measures for the future. The best AIoT example for risk management points to crowd analysis in public places.\n\nAIoT systems can also support comprehensive analysis of water levels and employee safety analysis according to desired goals. Organizations can use AIoT to stay one step ahead in the preparations and management of potential risks in future. For example, insurance companies have been leveraging AIoT applications to collect data from machines and factors for effective management of insurance risks.\n\nAIoT can also help businesses with easier real-time monitoring of systems, which can help save time and avoid business downtime. The consistent monitoring of different systems with AIoT helps in easier detection of anomalies and making predictions or decisions for the same.\n\nMost important of all, artificial intelligence of things or AIoT can achieve consistent real-time monitoring without any human intervention. As a result, it can achieve faster results. One of the notable examples of benefits of real-time monitoring with AIoT systems is the use of cameras for remote detection of leakages.\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence of things can mark the beginning of a new revolution in the field of technology. The answers to “What is the artificial intelligence of things?” would draw attention toward the use of cognitive abilities with consumer appliances. However, you can also find a broader range of applications for AIoT with possibilities for creating a seamless technological landscape. Here are some of the most prominent applications of AIoT that can give a new definition to the capabilities of AI and IoT.\n\nStarting from smart cities to smart homes and offices, AIoT can have a major influence on the world we are likely to witness in the future. The prominent artificial intelligence of things examples would point out how sensors can collect data to improve quality of life operational efficiency and guarantee cost-effective improvements. Smart retail stores can use AIoT to recognize shoppers’ faces with a camera and determine whether shoppers have scanned items at self-checkout before they leave the store.\n\nWith cameras being one of the widely available IoT devices, it is important to understand that AIoT use cases would be incomplete without video surveillance. Video surveillance with AIoT applications would capitalize on the power of AI and IoT for smarter video surveillance and security. AIoT uses machine learning algorithms for real-time analysis of data from video feeds of cameras, thereby detecting objects and recognizing people automatically.\n\nAnother notable area where artificial intelligence of things would have a formidable impact on technology is manufacturing. AIoT systems can empower Industrial Internet of Things to achieve better real-time monitoring of machinery and effective detection of defective parts.\n\nYou may come across conventional machine vision systems that offer quality control and fall back in terms of efficiency. However, AIoT can address the setbacks by providing the power of deep neural networks. As a result, AIoT systems can use deep neural networks for real-time detection of defective parts through comprehensive analysis of real-time video feeds.\n\nIdentify new ways to leverage the full potential of generative AI in business use cases and become an expert in generative AI technologies with Generative AI Skill Path\n\nThe overview of artificial intelligence of things AIoT showcases the reasons why it deserves to be one of the top trends in the domain of technology. Artificial intelligence and Internet of Things are the two most powerful technologies that have had distinct effects on various industries. At the same time, it is also important to consider the possibilities of blending AI and IoT to create AIoT.\n\nWith the power of AI, IoT systems would become capable of processing and analyzing the data collected and generated by IoT devices. Interestingly, the proven success of different examples of AIoT in the real world proves that there is a bright future for AIoT.

    "title": "TRON (TRX) Blockchain Platform Explained ",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Tron is a blockchain that allows developers to create decentralized applications. Discover more about Tron and its cryptocurrency, TRX.\n\nTron is a blockchain-based digital platform that seeks to become a distributed virtual machine for decentralized application development. Tron is supported by a non-profit foundation, the Tron Decentralized Autonomous Organization. The Tron blockchain\u0027s native token is TRX.\n\nThe Tron DAO\u0027s goal is to become the blockchain and platform developers use to create Web 3, the purported next iteration of the infrastructure behind the Internet and the World Wide Web.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is Tron?\n\nTron is a blockchain for creating decentralized applications. Its native token is TRX, which developers can use in their applications. Unlike similar blockchain projects, TRX is not used on the chain to pay transaction fees.\n\nTron is maintained by the Tron DAO, a Singapore non-profit organization.\n\nHistory of Tron\n\nThe Tron Foundation was established by Justin Sun in 2017 with the goal of creating a scalable blockchain and virtual machine that would allow content creators to share and monetize their content.\n\nIt was hoped that this design would attract content creators, who would maintain full ownership over their content by removing intermediary streaming services. Creators would receive payment from consumers, who would pay for the content using TRX.\n\nIn 2018, the Tron Foundation purchased BitTorrent, a peer-to-peer file-sharing system. The intent of this purchase was to use the existing system to facilitate faster content downloads and uploads.\n\nThe content creation and sharing model didn\u0027t attract the following its designer had hoped for, so the blockchain was redesigned for decentralized application development. The foundation and blockchain were fully decentralized in 2021 and turned over to the community. The foundation became Tron DAO (decentralized autonomous organization), governed by its users using smart contracts.\n\nHow Tron Works\n\nThe Tron blockchain and network have been compared to that of the Ethereum platform, but it operates somewhat differently. The Ethereum blockchain uses its native cryptocurrency, ether, as a payment method to network participants called validators.\n\nTron uses bandwidth points as payments. By default, each user has 600 bandwidth points, which represent 600 bytes of data. Transactions are measured in how many bytes they occupy in a block, so if a transaction is larger than the amount allowed by default, the user must purchase more bandwidth points. More bandwidth points can be acquired by staking TRX.\n\nTron uses staking in a consensus protocol called Delegated Proof of Stake. Stakers receive checkpoint submission rewards for submitting a snapshot of the blockchain state in addition to being paid transaction fees. Additionally, the amount they have staked gives them more voting power in governance activities, such as voting for the 27 super representatives. Super representatives are nodes that propose blocks for the blockchain, so there is no \"mining\" or competitive puzzle-solving for tokens.\n\nThese nodes also distribute rewards to super representative partners or candidates not elected to be among the 27 super representatives by setting a \"broker ratio\" in their wallet. The broker ratio is the ratio of rewards kept by the super rep to the rewards distributed to partners. The super reps are not required to distribute the rewards, but their broker ratio helps them receive votes during elections.\n\nHow to Get Tron\n\nTron can be purchased on many exchanges that support it, but it is not available on Binance.US, Gemini, or Coinbase. TRX is not minable like many cryptocurrencies; it must be earned by staking TRX you already own.\n\nMany people are willing to sell their TRX peer-to-peer (you can find many instructions on how to do this online), but this method is very risky. There are plenty of scammers who will try to sell you TRX for another crypto, or try to rent bandwidth to you so that you can make a transaction. They may accept other cryptocurrencies or tell you they accept fiat currency via PayPal or other services. It\u0027s easy to be tempted by some of these seemingly helpful community members, but P2P in this context is not safe. You are more than likely to become a scam victim using these methods, so it\u0027s best to use a regulated exchange.\n\nThe Future of Tron\n\nIt\u0027s always difficult to predict whether a cryptocurrency and blockchain will exist in the future. Like many blockchains, Tron has been turned over to a non-profit decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), Tron DAO. The organization appears to be active, sponsoring an event it calls HackaTron, where blockchain developers can compete to build decentralized applications.\n\nSince late 2022, TRX\u0027s market price has made a slow progressive climb. It had a market cap of $10.2 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of 324.1 million, suggesting that there is a significant amount of capital invested in TRX but relatively low liquidity.\n\nIn May 2024, Tron DAO announced that Google Cloud had joined its list of \"super representatives,\" trusted network nodes that propose new blocks for the blockchain. These representatives are voted in by the network after paying 9,999 TRX to become a candidate.\n\nThere appears to be an active, albeit small, community, a supportive and involved DAO, and investor interest. There is a good chance that TRX and Tron will maintain their position as long as there is interest in keeping the project alive.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTron is a blockchain created to host decentralized applications. Its native token, TRX, is used as a reward, to make payments, and as a speculative instrument for investors.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "As a technology, blockchain is quickly becoming unrivaled. One of the biggest problems that blockchain’s decentralized muscle can solve is voter fraud.\n\nBlockchain technology provides a platform for creating a highly secure, decentralized, anonymized, yet auditable chain of record, used presently in cryptocurrency systems. This same technology could also be used to record and report votes and prevent many types of voter fraud in elections. Especially after the misinformation surrounding the 2020 U.S. presidential elections, the world may be ready for blockchain voting on larger scales.\n\n",
    "content": "As a technology, blockchain is quickly becoming unrivaled. Although the Internet has long been familiar with other peer-to-peer applications for file sharing, music streaming, and more, the idea that these types of networks can provide their own security and resources has only been around since 2008. In the decade since its inception, blockchain was mostly tied to the success of the technology that created it, bitcoin.\n\nIn recent years, however, it has quickly become a star on its own. With the rise of the world’s favorite cryptocurrency, awareness of the mysterious and unique technology behind it also grew. Developers who recognized the value of blockchain are now racing to create new use cases for it and put their ideas into production.\n\nMany are finding that blockchain’s primary value lies in its ability to improve old systems. Enterprising observers saw the technology’s potential from the start, as bitcoin offered a more secure and transparent payment processing and banking solution than existing ones. In recent years, the same people have used blockchain to revolutionize industries far and wide, including cloud storage, smart contracts, crowdfunding, and even healthcare. However, one of the biggest problems that blockchain’s decentralized muscle can solve is voter fraud.\n\nBlockchain Serves the Voters\n\nIn its most basic form, blockchain is a digital ledger. The technology draws its power from the peers—or nodes—on its network to verify, process, and record all transactions across the system. This ledger is never stored, but rather exists on the “chain” supported by millions of nodes simultaneously. Thanks to encryption and decentralization, blockchain’s database of transactions is incorruptible, and each record is easily verifiable. The network cannot be taken down or influenced by a single party because it doesn’t exist in one place.\n\nIt’s not only financial transactions that work with blockchain, but any type of data transmission. This kind of system infrastructure is extremely useful for voting because a vote is a small piece of high-value data. Out of necessity, modern voting systems are largely stuck in the last century, and those that want to vote must leave their homes and submit paper ballots to a local authority. Why not bring this process online? Some have tried, but it has proven difficult to put faith in the results due to large gaps in security.\n\nBlockchain can solve the many problems discovered in these early attempts at online voting. A blockchain-based voting application does not concern itself with the security of its Internet connection, because any hacker with access to the terminal will not be able to affect other nodes. Voters can effectively submit their vote without revealing their identity or political preferences to the public. Officials can count votes with absolute certainty, knowing that each ID can be attributed to one vote, no fakes can be created, and that tampering is impossible.\n\nBringing Elections into the 21st Century\n\nThere are already companies working to bring blockchain to the voting populace. One such firm is Horizon State, which has launched a unique solution to answer the question, “If democracy was designed with today’s technology, what would it look like?” The company believes its first product is the answer. The company is currently preparing an ICO, planned for October.\n\nHorizon\u0027s secure digital ballot box represents a cost-effective and smart solution to the problems inherent in today’s voting procedures. Participants will use decision tokens (HST) to cast their votes from a mobile phone or PC, which are then logged into an immutable blockchain and used to reliably verify the outcome of the election. There can be no manipulation, recording errors, or tampering. More than voting, however, this system will be useful simply for making decisions in an environment where resources and authority are shared. It will also encourage participation.\n\nVoter apathy has seen the number of people show up to cast their votes dwindle in recent years, even as it has become more important to do so. By providing an irrefutable and easy way to vote from one’s phone or PC, these numbers would likely rise. Even governments have a reason to change the status quo: a single vote currently costs between $7.00 and $25.00, when all factors are considered. A blockchain product like this costs just $0.50 per vote.\n\nHorizon State co-founder Jamie Skella noted that “Democracy is the opportunity to share in the decision-making processes that relate to the shared matters which affect us. Democracy is about reaching a consensus on how to best use our shared resources to achieve the best outcomes for our partners, children, colleagues, staff, and fellow citizens. Where there are shared resources in any cooperative environment, there remains no question: we need better-shared decision-making tools and processes.”Blockchain-based elections are being trialed in the real world. In November 2018, the Thai Democrat Party, Thailand’s oldest political party, held a primary election to elect its new party leader using ZCoin, marking the first large-scale political election carried out using blockchain technology. The vote was concluded with a total of 127,479 votes that came from all over Thailand.﻿﻿﻿A True Democracy\n\nBlockchain is paving the way for a direct democracy, where people can decide the course of policy themselves, rather than rely on representatives to do it for them. While the rules of a political election may have to be changed to make way for such a transparent system, blockchain is also ideal for informing business decisions, guiding general meetings, polling, censuses, and more.\n\nThe use cases for blockchain voting software are many and diverse. Its ability to engage and manage a constituency is crucial to the future of society, not just to produce a transparent outcome but to encourage all people to participate in their communities. Currently, the technology is still in its infancy, but it matures alongside the young voters it will one day help, and looks to be a key part of our collective future.\n\n",

    "content": "The Bitcoin open interest is a good indicator of how investors are viewing the cryptocurrency and what bets they’re making. This is why the metric hitting a new all-time high is a big deal, carrying serious implications for the market. Once again, the Bitcoin open interest has set a new record and this could spell doom for the digital asset, even if just in the short-term.\n\nIn an interesting turn of events, the Bitcoin open interest has now risen to a new all-time high. After hitting a record high of $39.03 billion back in May, the open interest had declined for a while, even dropping below $30 billion back in May.\n\nFollowing this, the Bitcoin open interest fluctuated for a few months, taking the price along with it for the ride. However, with the recovery in the market, the open interest has been rising once again, exploding to new highs as the BTC price shot for $70,000.\n\nOn Monday, the Bitcoin open interest saw a notable surge, rising a whopping $1.5 billion in a single day. This translated to a 5.94% rise in the 24-hour period, according to data from Coinglasss and pushed the open interest above $39.5 billion, the highest on record s far.\n\nThe major surges in open interest came from exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, and OKX, all of which saw an average of an 8% increase in the Bitcoin open interest. For example, the Binance Bitcoin futures open interest made a new all-time high of $9.05 billion.\n\nThe Bitcoin open interest reaching a new all-time high is indicative of increased interest as traders begin taking various positions in the cryptocurrency. However, in the past, when the open interest has reached new record highs, it has carried implications for the market.\n\nBack in March, when the Bitcoin open interest reached an ATH, it indicated the top of the market, with the open interest falling over the next few months and the BTC price falling as well. Following the March ATH, the Bitcoin price saw a 20% drawdown less than two months later.\n\nIf this trend holds, then the recent ATH could be the signal for a decline. By Monday, the Bitcoin price had already started responding, falling from $70,000 to below $67,000 in a matter of hours before recovering. A continuation of this downtrend could easily send the Bitcoin price falling more than 10% from here again and reaching below $60,000.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "There are a few things that make Jack Dorsey’s vision for Web5 distinct, including not wanting to completely replace Web2 but work with it.\n\n",
    "content": "The world is still getting its collective head around Web3 – a suite of decentralized protocols that add a (disputably) censorship-resistant financial layer to the internet. So why did Jack Dorsey, the creator of Web2 platform Twitter, skip right ahead to what he calls \"Web5\"?\n\nIt turns out that, despite the name, Web5 does not follow the yet-to-be-created Web4. The Web5 platform, announced in June, 2022 by TBD, the crypto and decentralized finance arm of Dorsey’s payments company, Block (née Square), is firmly based on Web3 tech, but promises “an extra decentralized web platform.”\n\nTo land on the name Web5, TBD just added Web3 (an internet powered by blockchain-based smart contracts) to Web2 (centralized content platforms, like Twitter or Facebook). Put simply: 3 + 2 \u003d 5.\n\nWeb5’s core idea is to “put you in control of your data and identity” – a core tenet of Web3’s decentralized identity systems. Instead of inviting users to sign up for an account on a centralized platform (like an Instagram account), Web3 protocols reference users by their crypto wallet addresses. Protocols like the Ethereum Name Service let users turn their wallet’s garbled alphanumeric string into a word or phrase (like jane.eth) similar to how Domain Name Service (DNS) allowed websites to have addresses like coindesk.com rather than a long string of numbers like 54.235.191.121. Decentralized data storage is a concept already in existence and is provided by platforms like Filecoin and IPFS.\n\nDorsey’s Web5 offers similar capabilities. Instead of an internet that relies on accounts provided by companies that hold customer data “captive in app silos,” Web5 pushes for “a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center.”\n\nThere are three pillars at Web5’s core: self-owned decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials and decentralized web nodes for storing data and relaying messages. It sounds a lot like what decentralized identity services have been doing since the Ethereum Name Service launched in May 2017.\n\nSo, what’s new here – apart from yet another stab at decentralized identities? Part of the answer may lie in Dorsey’s allegiance to bitcoin and his aggressive dismissal of Web3 culture. For Dorsey, bitcoin, launched in a truly decentralized fashion in 2009, is the only cryptocurrency that matters, the rest having been corrupted by venture capitalists who bent the platforms to their will. Accordingly, Web5 is run without any “special utility tokens or subjective consensus” that is part of the governance-token, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-controlled protocols like the Ethereum Name Service.\n\nIn doing so, Web5 sounds like an attempt to rid Web3 of the centralized actors that Dorsey credits with sullying the mission of decentralization. Zion, a self-described Web5 app, uses Bitcoin’s base layer to help content creators work together with fans. But avoiding corruption is, of course, difficult: Web5’s nascent community already balked at TBD’s attempt to trademark the term Web5.\n\nThe other thing that is different from Web3 is that Web5 works with existing Web2 services; it does not seek to replace them entirely. Web5’s pitch deck provides the example of Groove adding a playlist to a Web5 user’s decentralized identifier, which another music service, Tidal, can use to fashion its own playlists within the app. The decentralized identifier prevents the user from having to recreate their preferences on another platform.\n\nTBD’s other example of Web5 in action involves one user granting her hotel, airline and rental car provider the ability to add information to her database about her trip. The user can revoke access at any time and choose another service to “help her visualize her itinerary.” Again, the idea is to tie data that’s usually locked inside centralized services – something TBD calls “a massive, unworkable mess” – to a single user-controlled identity. Think of it as similar to how many sites and apps leverage a user’s Google account to log in, but in this case it will be a single login with a decentralized network of nodes.\n\nWill it work? Time will tell. So far, the only decentralized identity service that’s caught on in any measure is the Ethereum Name Service, and the only data storage system with any cachet is the interplanetary file service (better known as IPFS).\n\nOne of the key things that distinguish TBD’s ambition is the backing of its billionaire progenitor, Jack Dorsey. But it’s unclear how Web5 would make money or why, ideological reasons aside, the company is creating such a service. Strategy consultant Adrien Book laid out the problem pretty well in a Medium post that followed Web5’s announcement: “Jack seems to want to keep the taste of Web3 without the calories. It’s like a high school student saying ‘yeah, but communism has never been REALLY tried as it’s meant to be.’ It’s naive.”\n\n",

    "content": "The XRP price has climbed by over 4% within the last 24 hours, extending its bullish trend observed over the past month. This increase propelled the token to a four-month peak of $0.6377 early on Tuesday, outperforming the top 10 cryptocurrencies in the market.\n\nHowever, this recent surge in value coincides with strong criticism from key Ripple executives, including CEO Brad Garlinghouse and the company’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty, directed at the leadership of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAs Bitcoinist reported early Tuesday, the SEC amended its complaint against the world’s largest exchange, Binance, specifically adjusting the classification of 10 cryptocurrencies, such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Cosmos (ATOM), that were initially deemed as “securities.”\n\nBrad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, responded to this development by emphasizing the SEC’s perceived “hypocrisy” in the classification of crypto tokens and its management of crypto regulations over the past year under the guidance of Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nGarlinghouse criticized the SEC for what he sees as a lack of clarity in the consistent application of rules, suggesting possible political agendas or questionable litigation tactics. “Definitely not faithful allegiance to the law,” Garlinghouse said.\n\nStuart Alderoty, Ripple’s CLO, also weighed in on the situation, pointing out apparent inconsistencies between the lawsuits involving Binance and the US-based crypto exchange Coinbase, both initiated around the same period in the last quarter of 2023.\n\nAlderoty highlighted the SEC’s response to judicial scrutiny in the Binance case compared to its stance in the Coinbase lawsuit, particularly regarding the classification of tokens, in which twelve cryptocurrencies, most of which were also included in the Binance case, were also deemed securities.\n\nDespite XRP not being implicated in the recent SEC decision, its price continues to surge following a 33% uptrend over the past month. The sustained momentum fueled by bullish investors suggests a potential push towards the $1 threshold.\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez notes that XRP’s price has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern for six years. Martinez anticipates a bullish breakout if XRP surpasses the $0.90 mark, especially in light of the ongoing recovery from a significant dip that drove the token to a 17-month low of $0.3825 on July 5.\n\nHowever, a critical event looms on August 1 when Ripple Labs is scheduled to release 1 billion XRP from its escrow account, which this influx of supply could potentially outstrip demand, leading to a subsequent decline for the XRP price if market interest fails to materialize.\n\nThe key will be to watch the $0.5353 level, where the token’s 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) currently resides, which could act as a notable support in the scenario of a further decline following Ripple’s token release.\n\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com\n\n",

    "content": "When most people hear the word blockchain, which refers to a type of decentralized ledger technology, they immediately connect the term with cryptocurrencies. However, it is important to keep in mind that bitcoin just happened to be one of blockchain’s earliest and most popular applications; most experts believe that the potential for other applications of blockchain technology is vast.\n\nWhat Is Blockchain Technology?\n\nIn the most general sense, a blockchain is a system for recording information, although it is distinct from a typical database in the way it stores information; the information in a blockchain is stored in such a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.\n\nBlockchain technology promises a secure, peer-to-peer mechanism for verifying information. Each \"block\" in a blockchain contains a record of transactions in a decentralized ledger. Taken together, the blocks form a “chain” in a peer-to-peer network.\n\nApplications for Blockchain Technology\n\nThis impressive technology provides the support necessary for the decentralized, anonymized tracking and transaction of digital currencies around the world. While blockchains allow for cryptocurrencies to function, their functionality has applications beyond cryptocurrency. For example, banking and fintech payment companies have already demonstrated a major interest in blockchain technology.\n\nFrom insurance and real estate to crowdfunding and data management, the potential applications of blockchain technology are numerous, and it\u0027s likely that there will continue to be new ways of adapting this technology to the mainstream business world in the future.\n\nHowever, there is one important use of blockchain technology that exists outside its more traditional business applications: Some of the world\u0027s emerging economies are benefiting from the integration of blockchain technology in various ways. In diverse countries such as India, Kenya, and East Africa, blockchain technology has found uses in banking and financial services, supply chains, agriculture, and in managing land ownership records.\n\nAmong its many advantages (first and foremost being its ability to keep data secure), blockchain technology also claims to speed up and reduce the cost of transactions, and boost financial inclusion by providing more opportunities for those without easy access to financial services.\n\nChallenges for Blockchain Implementation in Emerging Countries\n\nBefore we discuss opportunities, let\u0027s touch on why it may be particularly difficult for an emerging country to implement blockchain solutions. The hurdles below are not an exhaustive list but instead an overview of the unique challenges emerging countries must overcome.\n\nBanking Opportunities\n\nIn many parts of the world, individuals do not have easy access to banking services. With blockchain technology, users across the globe could access banking services where they otherwise wouldn\u0027t have the opportunity. Particularly, individuals in emerging economies where there are not standard banks readily accessible could make use of blockchain technology to access these services. One specific application is the use of blockchain for instant transfers of money between countries and without major fees and delay times.\n\nBlockchain also offers a visible, impermeable ledger, protecting the accuracy of financial transactions. This may lessen instances of fraud, corruption, and other wrongdoing that frequently occur in the banking industry. Emerging nations can improve the security and dependability of their banking systems, boosting user confidence, by utilizing the immutability and transparency of the blockchain.\n\nLast, access to credit is frequently restricted in emerging economies, especially for those without established credit histories. Blockchain can make it possible to develop decentralized credit scoring systems that use alternate data sources, including transaction records and payment histories, to evaluate creditworthiness. This could create opportunities for people and companies to receive loans and credit facilities based on their credit profiles created using blockchain technology.\n\nExamples of Blockchain in Emerging Countries\n\nIn India, ConsenSys Ventures, a blockchain software firm, has worked with the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog, the Indian government’s policy think tank, on implementing blockchain in a land titling project. ConsenSys Ventures also signed an agreement with the Andhra Pradesh state government for an array of uses for its technology, including in land titling, supply chains, and health records.\n\nIn Kenya, IBM partnered with Twiga Foods, a business-to-business logistics platform for kiosks and food stalls across Africa, to extend micro-finance loans to vendors. These loans were intended to help vendors buy and manage more inventory. IBM\u0027s contribution was to build a blockchain-enabled lending platform that could determine the creditworthiness of the food vendors.\n\nIn Nigeria, blockchain technology has been used to monitor toxin levels along the River Niger, where efforts are underway to clean up the river belt. International organizations that are funding these projects rely on this data as part of their reporting requirements.\n\nHaiti, the victim of hurricane and earthquake damage caused over the last decade, also stands to benefit from blockchain.\n\nThe Haitian government has suggested that blockchain technology could be used to record and register property transactions, voting, intellectual property, and other aspects of bureaucracy. In 2019, the La Banque de la République d’Haïti announced that it was considering a pilot program utilizing blockchain technology to create a digital version of the Haitian Gourde. The goal of this project would be to improve the domestic payments system and promote financial inclusion in Haiti.\n\nOver the past few years, the Business Development and Investment (BDI) project in Haiti has helped thousands of producers. The BDI project was designed to support the reconstruction efforts after Haiti\u0027s 2010 earthquake, but was forced to redouble its efforts due to natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, assassination of its President, lockdown due to socio-political unrest, and gang-fueled insecurity.\n\nThe project aimed to attract private sector investment through the creation of special industrial zones but later shifted to facilitating the export of existing high-quality agricultural products. To enable farmers to obtain higher prices, the project helped develop the capacity of third-party service providers, providing them with standard operating procedures, access to quality transport and logistics services, and supplying them with working capital. The entire project hinged on a blockchain solution for traceability and payments was developed, allowing direct payments to farmers.\n\nThe Future of Blockchain Technology in Emerging Economies\n\nFor Paul Domjan, former global head of research, analytics, and data at investment bank Tellimer (formerly Exotix), emerging nations are the most promising beneficiaries of blockchain tech. He argues that, because \"frontier markets in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia lag far behind [in the area of ownership recording], with average performance less than half that of the best-performing economies,\" they are primed for the benefits of blockchain.\n\nAmnesty International program director Mark Dummett has voiced cautious support for the integration of blockchain into efforts to address these and other problems plaguing developing nations, saying, \"You have to be wary of technological solutions to problems that are also political and economic, but blockchain may help. We\u0027re not against it.\"The Bottom Line\n\nBesides the applications listed above, supporters of blockchain believe that it could enhance the distribution of government services in these nations, help to provide identity services, and even help to enhance freedom of speech and anti-corruption activities as well.\n\n",

    "content": "During the 2024 Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, Jan van Eck, CEO of global asset manager and Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer VanEck, made headlines with his revealing comments about his personal Bitcoin holdings.\n\nDuring his appearance at the conference, Van Eck began by sharing his perspective on Bitcoin’s growth and evolution over time, likening it to a “teenager” that is not yet fully formed, as many investor classes have not yet joined the market.\n\nAddressing his investment approach, Van Eck revealed that in his conversations with other attendees at Bitcoin conferences, he has found that they tend to hold significantly more Bitcoin in their portfolios. He further stated:\n\nEveryone I meet at Bitcoin conferences owns way more in their own portfolio, and I always say, wait a minute, I always want to tell people what I’m doing personally because they should know.\n\nInterestingly, when asked about his portfolio, Jan Van Eck replied that he owns “well over 30%” in Bitcoin without disclosing the amount in BTC or USD.\n\nThis disclosure comes as VanEck recently published a report outlining a significant bullish long-term price projection for BTC, suggesting that the Bitcoin price could reach a value of $2.9 million per coin by 2050.\n\nPer the report, Bitcoin’s scalability issues, which have historically hindered widespread adoption, will be resolved through the emergence of advanced Layer-2 (L2) solutions.\n\nBy combining Bitcoin’s “immutable property rights and sound money principles” with the increased functionality of Layer 2 technology, the asset manager envisions creating a new, globally accessible financial system.\n\nUnder this optimistic scenario, the VanEck team believes that by 2050, Bitcoin could be used to settle 10% of the globe’s international trade and 5% of the world’s domestic trade.\n\nAccording to the report, this level of adoption could lead to central banks holding 2.5% of their assets in Bitcoin, driving the price of the largest cryptocurrency on the market to a substantial $2.9 million per coin by the year 2050.\n\nIn addition, the report estimates that Bitcoin L2 solutions could be worth a total of $7.6 trillion, or approximately 12% of Bitcoin’s total projected value. The asset manager further noted:\n\nThough it has established itself as an important store of value assets, our projection of its price more than 25 years into the future is predicated on the assumption that increasing numbers of people around the globe use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange.\n\nAt the time of writing, BTC was trading at $67,600, up over 4% in the last 24 hours, after hitting a weekly low of $63,500 on Thursday.\n\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com\n\n",

    "content": "Machine learning focuses on developing predictive models that can forecast the output for specific input data. ML engineers and developers use different steps to optimize the trained model. On top of it, they also determine the performance of different machine learning models by leveraging different parameters.\n\nHowever, choosing a model with the best performance does not mean that you have to choose a model with the highest accuracy. You need to learn about underfitting and overfitting in machine learning to uncover the reasons behind poor performance of ML models.\n\nMachine learning research involves the use of cross-validation and train-test splits to determine the performance of ML models on new data. Overfitting and underfitting represent the ability of a model to capture the interplay between input and output for the model. Let us learn more about overfitting and underfitting, their causes, potential solutions, and the differences between them.\n\n\n\nThe ideal way to learn about overfitting and underfitting would involve a review of generalization, bias, and variance in machine learning. It is important to note that the principles of overfitting and underfitting in machine learning are closely related to generalization and bias-variance tradeoffs. Here is an overview of the crucial elements that are responsible for overfitting and underfitting in ML models.\n\nGeneralization refers to the effectiveness of an ML model in applying the concepts they learned to specific examples that were not a part of the training data. However, generalization is a tricky issue in the real world. ML models use three different types of datasets: training, validation, and testing sets. Generalization error points out the performance of an ML model on new cases, which is the sum of bias error and variance error. You must also account for irreducible errors that come from noise in the data, which is an important factor for generalization errors.\n\nBias is the result of errors due to extremely simple assumptions made by ML algorithms. In mathematical terms, bias in ML models is the average squared difference between model predictions and actual data. You can understand underfitting in machine learning by finding out models with higher bias errors. Some of the notable traits of models with higher bias include higher error rates, more generalization, and failure to capture relevant data trends. High-bias models are the most likely candidates for underfitting.\n\nVariance is another prominent generalization error that emerges from the excessive sensitivity of ML models to subtle variations in training data. It represents the change in the performance of ML models during evaluation with respect to validation data. Variance is a crucial determinant of overfitting in machine learning, as high-variance models are more likely to be complex. For example, models with multiple degrees of freedom showcase higher variance. On top of that, high-variance models have more noise in the dataset, and they strive to ensure that all data points are close to each other.\n\nTake your first step towards learning about artificial intelligence through AI Flashcards\n\nUnderfitting refers to the scenario in which ML models cannot accurately capture the relationship between input and output variables. Therefore, it can lead to a higher error rate on the training dataset as well as new data. Underfitting happens due to over-simplification of a model that can happen due to a lack of regularization, more input features, and more training time. Underfitting in ML models leads to training errors and loss of performance due to the inability to capture dominant trends in the data.\n\nThe problem with underfitting in machine learning is that it does not allow the model to generalize effectively for new data. Therefore, the model is not suitable for prediction or classification tasks. On top of that, you are more likely to find underfitting in ML models with higher bias and lower variance. Interestingly, you can identify such behavior when you use the training dataset, thereby enabling easier identification of underfitted models.\n\nUnderstand the actual potential of AI and the best practices for using AI tools with the AI For Business Course.\n\nOverfitting happens in machine learning when an algorithm has been trained closely or exactly according to its training dataset. It creates problems for a model in making accurate conclusions or predictions for any new data. Machine learning models use a sample dataset for training, and it has some implications for overfitting. If the model is extremely complex and trains for an extended period on the sample data, then it could learn the irrelevant information in the dataset.\n\nThe consequence of overfitting in machine learning revolves around the model memorizing the noise and fitting closely with the training data. As a result, it would end up showcasing errors for classification or prediction tasks. You can identify overfitting in ML models by checking higher variance and low error rates.\n\nML researchers, engineers, and developers can address the problems of underfitting and overfitting with proactive detection. You can take a look at the underlying causes for better identification. For example, one of the most common causes of overfitting is the misinterpretation of training data. Therefore, the model would lead to limited accuracy in results for new data even if overfitting leads to higher accuracy scores.\n\nThe meaning of underfitting and overfitting in machine learning also suggests that underfitted models cannot capture the relationship between input and output data due to over-simplification. As a result, underfitting leads to poor performance even with training datasets. Deploying overfitted and underfitted models can lead to losses for businesses and unreliable decisions. Take a look at the proven ways to detect overfitting and underfitting in ML models.\n\nYou can explore opportunities to detect overfitting across different stages in the machine learning lifecycle. Plotting the training error and validation error can help identify when overfitting takes shape in an ML model. Some of the most effective techniques to detect overfitting include resampling techniques, such as k-fold-cross-validation. You can also hold back a validation set or choose other methods, such as using a simplistic model as a benchmark.\n\nThe basic understanding of overfitting and underfitting in machine learning can help you detect the anomalies at the right time. You can find problems of underfitting by using two different methods. First of all, you must remember that the loss for training and validation will be significantly higher for underfitted models. Another method to detect underfitting involves plotting a graph with data points and a fixed curve. If the classifier curve is extremely simple, then you might have to worry about underfitting in the model.\n\n\n\nUnderfitting and overfitting have a significant influence on the performance of machine learning models. Therefore, it is important to know the best ways to deal with the problems before they cause any damage. Here are the trusted approaches for resolving underfitting and overfitting in ML models.\n\nYou can find different ways to deal with overfitting in machine learning algorithms, such as adding more data or using data augmentation techniques. Removal of irrelevant aspects from the data can help in improving the model. On the other hand, you can also go for other techniques, such as regularization and ensembling.\n\nThe best practices to address the problem of underfitting include allocating more time for training and eliminating noise from data. In addition, you can deal with underfitting in machine learning by choosing a more complex model or trying a different model. Adjustment of regularization parameters also helps in dealing with overfitting and underfitting.\n\nEnroll now in the ChatGPT Fundamentals Course and dive into the world of prompt engineering with practical demonstrations.\n\nThe fundamental concepts provide relevant answers to the question, “What is the difference between overfitting and underfitting machine learning?” on different parameters. For example, you can notice the differences in the methods used for detecting and curing underfitting and overfitting. Underfitting and overfitting are the prominent reasons behind lack of performance in ML models. You can understand the difference between them with the following example.\n\nLet us assume that a school has appointed two substitute teachers to take classes in absence of regular teachers. One of the teachers, John, is an expert at mathematics, while the other teacher, Rick, has a good memory. Both the teachers were called up as substitutes when the science teacher did not turn up one day.\n\nJohn, being an expert at mathematics, failed to answer some of the questions that students asked. On the other hand, Rick had memorized the lesson that he had to teach and could answer questions from the lesson. However, Rick failed to answer questions that were about complexly new topics.\n\nIn this example, you can notice that John has learned from a small part of the training data, i.e., mathematics only, thereby suggesting underfitting. On the other hand, Rick can perform well on the known instances and fails on new data, thereby suggesting overfitting.\n\nIdentify new ways to leverage the full potential of generative AI in business use cases and become an expert in generative AI technologies with Generative AI Skill Path\n\nThe explanation for underfitting and overfitting in machine learning showcases how they can affect the performance and accuracy of ML algorithms. You are likely to encounter such problems due to the data used for training ML models. For example, underfitting is the result of training ML models on specific niche datasets.\n\nOn the other hand, overfitting happens when the ML models use the whole training dataset for learning and end up failing for new tasks.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain technology is being taken seriously by the financial sector as it may prove to be a great disrupter to the traditional banking industry.\n\n",
    "content": "One of the biggest threats to the banking sector today is technology. Whether it is coming from large technology firms such as Google Inc. (GOOG), Apple Inc. (AAPL), eBay Inc. (EBAY) or Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), or from new financial technology (FinTech) start-ups, traditional banks are beginning to take notice, and some of them are now taking part as well.\n\nOne potential disrupter for the financial industry today comes from applications involving blockchain technology—the tamper-proof system of distributed ledgers that underlie cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Large financial institutions, from investment banks to stock exchanges to central banks, are all beginning to work on their own blockchain-based solutions in order to stay on top of this innovation.\n\nBanks Are Taking Notice\n\nBefore looking at just how blockchain technology can disrupt traditional banking, it is worth taking note of some of the key institutions that have publicly announced interest in it (meanwhile, many other banks are doing so without informing the public).\n\nPayments and Remittances\n\nThe most obvious and basic use for blockchain technology is its use as a payments system. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies act both as digital money and a method to send payments in that money form around the globe. These transactions require only an internet connection and take place instantly. While it is true that it may take many minutes for a transaction to be 100% confirmed, the transaction itself takes place in a matter of moments. These transactions are borderless, secure, and largely anonymous. Furthermore, transaction costs are minimal, costing only a few cents per transaction making it a much cheaper way to send money around the world than wire companies like Western Union (WU) and Wise or via credit card processors such as Visa Inc. (V), Mastercard Inc. (MA), or Discover Financial Services (DFS). A merchant not wanting to pay the initial and ongoing fees in order to accept credit cards could take electronic payment via a cryptocurrency instead for a fraction of the cost.\n\nRemittance overseas is a difficult undertaking. The fees are high, the processing time is slow, the money can be intercepted or stolen, and there are legal and tax issues that must be considered. A blockchain-based system would eliminate these problems. There are already dozens of companies that have been started to facilitate remittances in this way.\n\nAccount Balances and Deposits\n\nConsumers generally utilize banks to hold deposits in checking and savings accounts. But once you deposit money into a bank account, the bank loans most of it out via fractional reserve banking. As a result, most of the money that shows up when you view your account balance is not held by the bank. In fact, a bank run causes a bank to fail when too many customers attempt to withdraw their money all at the same time, and the money just isn\u0027t there. A bank account balance, therefore, is just an accounting entry.\n\nThe blockchain is ultimately a ledger that represents accounting entries. Therefore, bank accounts could come to be represented on blockchains making them more secure, accessible, and cheaper to maintain. Furthermore, it could help alleviate the risk of bank runs.\n\nSecondary Market Trading and Clearing\n\nThe simplest purchase of a company\u0027s shares to a complex over-the-counter currency swap requires clearing and settlement of trades. Ownership of the asset or contract being traded must verifiably change hands and be recorded. Today, exchange fees and clearing fees are added to the cost of each trade and can become sizable over time and given large volumes of orders.\n\nIf the ownership of shares could exist on a blockchain and any change of ownership could be immediately validated and confirmed, it would greatly reduce transaction costs and clearing costs for all sorts of asset classes from stocks to bonds to derivatives to commodities to real estate. It is entirely possible that such storied institutions as the New York Stock Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade may one day be replaced by a distributed ledger technology that is more secure, robust, and less expensive to operate and transact on.\n\nOverstock (OSTK) recently announced it was developing a blockchain-based asset exchange called T0 in order to directly issue some of its corporate bonds to investors. New York-based bitcoin exchange Coinsetter has announced that it will roll out a blockchain-based platform to clear over-the-counter transactions which allows settling in T+10 minutes. To put that into perspective, buying a share of stock on a U.S. exchange takes T+2 days to settle.\n\nPrimary Market Issuance and IPOs\n\nIf secondary market trading can occur on blockchains, can primary markets also exist? The answer is yes. Imagine you are a company seeking to raise capital via issuing new shares to the public via an IPO. Today, this would be a very expensive undertaking requiring an investment bank (or a syndicate of such banks) to underwrite and sell your shares. This can cost up to 7% of a company\u0027s gross proceeds.\n\nNow, imagine being able to issue shares of your company by yourself directly to the blockchain where you can then sell them in exchange for money. These virtual shares can then be exchanged on secondary markets that also exist via the blockchain. If this scenario becomes accepted by the public, it could be a huge disrupter to both asset exchanges as well as the investment banking industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlockchain technology is being taken seriously by the financial sector as it may prove to be a great disrupter to the traditional banking industry. The tamper-proof, decentralized, immutable nature of the blockchain makes it ideal for reducing costs and streamlining everything from payments, asset trading, securities issuance, retail banking, and clearing and settlements. It becomes obvious that blockchain technology is much more than Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. While those implementations as payments and money systems are indeed disruptive, the greater disruption may come from alternative uses of these unique and powerful characteristics.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A hard fork is a radical change to a blockchain\u0027s programming that makes it incompatible with the older version.\n\nA hard fork is an event in which a change to a blockchain results in two branches: one that follows previous protocols and one that follows the new version. In a hard fork, holders of tokens in the original blockchain will also be granted tokens in the new fork, but participants must choose which blockchain to continue verifying. Hard forks are not specific to any single blockchain—it is an event that many have gone through. Hard forks occur for several reasons, such as developer disagreements, required updates to a blockchain, or someone attempting to make another blockchain and cryptocurrency they control.\n\nDevelopers cannot force changes on a public blockchain that relies on participation. Public blockchains rely on their participants, so changes must be implemented by them, not forced upon them. Otherwise, they can refuse to accept the changes and keep their preferred version.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Hard Fork?\n\nA blockchain hard fork is a change in programming that is incompatible with the old programming. This essentially creates a new blockchain and cryptocurrency. Hard forks generally require all nodes or users who wish to stay on the new chain to upgrade to the latest version of the software.\n\nHard forks may be initiated by developers as part of routine progress or maintenance on a blockchain. They may also be created by a faction of the crypto community that wants to take a different direction with the blockchain.\n\nHow Hard Forks Work\n\nA hard fork is when a new blockchain version emerges that is incompatible with the original version. It is not always an adverse event; in fact, many blockchains have undergone hard forks to implement necessary changes.\n\nBlockchains are basically programs that create and store files of information on a network of computers and devices. There are usually layers of software completing different tasks, some methods for the network to reach an agreement on the blockchain\u0027s state, and many network participants. Each layer\u0027s underlying programming can be changed as needed, but it has to be accepted by the network\u0027s participants to be adopted.\n\nBecause blockchains are essentially programs and scripts, they can be affected by errors, bugs, network communication problems, hardware failures, or other issues. Blockchains also rely on a large number of network participants to host versions for security.\n\nWhen developers publish a change to any of a blockchain\u0027s functions, one of two things happen: a hard fork or a soft fork. If the change is drastic enough to prevent a participant running the old version from participating in the blockchain\u0027s processes, the change is considered to have created a hard fork in the blockchain. Conversely, a change that allows old and new nodes to run is considered a soft fork.\n\nIn a hard fork event, participants are faced with a choice—they can update their software to the new version or not upgrade their software and use the old (and now unmaintained) blockchain.\n\nReasons for a Hard Fork\n\nThere are several reasons or even events that cause developers to implement a hard fork. For instance, when the hack on the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) occurred, the Ethereum blockchain was forked by a nearly unanimous vote.\n\nThe fork rolled back transactions that siphoned off tens of millions of dollars worth of digital currency by an anonymous hacker. The hard fork also helped DAO token holders get their ether (ETH) funds returned. However, some miners kept mining the old chain, which was picked up by OTC desks and given a price discovery order book. Poloniex listed this currency also, and some of the Ethereum community decided to keep this version and created Ethereum Classic.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHard forks are a change in programming that results in a blockchain split. Sometimes, hard forks are controversial in the community involved in a blockchain; at other times, they are necessary for a blockchain to progress.\n\nIn situations with controversy, participants and users can either upload the updated blockchain and begin processing it or reject it and use the old chain. This is how several blockchains and cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic, started.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

    "summary": "The renowned a16z VC talks to Daniel Kuhn about his new book, “Read Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet.”\n\n",
    "content": "There is a growing divide between techno-optimists and pessimists. Growing up I vaguely remember a public debate between bible thumpers and people who wanted evolution taught in school. The same sort of argument is playing out in a number of different ways today — a media “Techlash” vs. Silicon Valley, humanists vs. nerds, progressivism vs. material progress — but recently, in his \"Techno-Optimist Manifesto,\" venture capitalist Marc Andreessen boiled it down to a war between deccelerationists and accelerationists. That is, those who want the rate of technology to slow, stagnate or reverse and those who want the opposite.\n\nChris Dixon is a speaker at CoinDesk\u0027s Consensus conference, beginning May 29, in Austin, Texas.\n\nIn Andreessen’s eyes, the debate has metastasized to touch nearly every corner of human endeavor. And in many ways it has: with the increasing rate of internet adoption, tech plays an ever-larger role in our daily lives. More and more of our interactions are mediated by social media and mobile apps. As cash falls by the wayside, almost all economic activity is routed through digital rails operated by banks or fintechs. We’re streaming more, playing more online games and even taking work online.\n\nWhile many of these developments have made modern life more convenient and efficient, tech also causes problems. Even if you buy into the idea that all technologies are neutral, just “tools” to be put to better or worse use, it’s hard not to think that there’s something dystopian about the past two decades of technological progress. As many crypto advocates point out, as the internet grows, our lives are put in the hands of a few monopolistic companies.\n\nThis is the point of departure for Chris Dixon’s new book, “Read Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet,” published on Jan. 30. Dixon, a long-time colleague of Andreessen, who runs the independent crypto arm at storied VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), traces the lineage of the web to find what has gone awry. What started out as a network of interoperable and open protocols, what’s now known as Web1, has been sectioned off in Web2. It’s an era where essentially five companies control who gets to use what, when and why. Thankfully, Dixon argues, what comes next, Web3, offers real solutions.\n\nWeb3 is a bit of a buzzword, Dixon admits. For him, it can be defined as the “ownership” layer that has been so far missing from the web. While Facebook and Twitter did connect the world in some sense, it never allowed users to own their identities or accounts. It’s a similar story across digital banking, blogging or really anything online with a sign-in and password. With the rise of blockchains, what Dixon refers to as virtual computers, users are finally in control over their digital lives — so long as they maintain control over their private keys.\n\nIt might take a techno-optimist to think that blockchain can reverse the consolidation of the web, considering the trillions of dollars at play, how little adoption has taken place so far and the industry’s battered reputation in the mainstream. But for Dixon, apart from crypto’s ability to hand back control to everyday users, blockchains also offer a space for permissionless development. We may not know exactly what blockchains are useful for today, but so long as there are people as excited about the tech as Dixon is, we’re likely to find out eventually.\n\nSee also: It\u0027s Time to BUIDL\n\nCoinDesk spoke with Dixon, who will be at Consensus 2024, to get a better sense of the three eras of the web, his work as a venture capitalist funding the next wave of crypto startups and whether he thinks direct democracy is over- or underrated, among other pressing issues. The interview has been lightly edited and condensed.\n\nThe overall theme of the book is the evolution of the internet from Web1, composed of open source protocols, to Web2, which was walled off and siloed, to the re-decentralizing force of Web3 and crypto. Would you consider blockchain to be part of the wider open-source movement and in what ways are Web1 and Web3 different?\n\nIn the book I talked about outside versus inside-out technologies, which is this idea that, if you look at the history of computing, there\u0027s things like the iPhone and AI that came from established institutions like Apple and Google and Stanford, and then there\u0027s a whole separate tradition of hackers at the fringe, building stuff. Early PCs — the Homebrew Computer Club was Steve Jobs. They were outsiders. Open-source software, Linux and the whole stack of open source software came from outside. There\u0027s no central casting for computing platforms. Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, was a physicist at CERN. Blockchain is very much in that mold, inheriting that tradition of deep believers of openness and shared systems that’s motivated through a distinct ethos.\n\nA lot of people call Facebook a “platform” because you can technically build apps on it. Is there a better definition for what makes a platform, in the sense that blockchains won’t kick you off like Facebook did to Zynga?\n\nFacebook may be a platform, but it\u0027s very shaky. There\u0027s a long history of entrepreneurs who tried to build on top of Facebook and Twitter, and felt essentially robbed because they changed the terms-of-condition and APIs. I think we see this going on with Apple right now with Epic suing them and companies like Netflix and Spotify not creating apps for the Meta Quest Pro or Apple Vision headsets. A platform is supposed to be a predictable, safe place that developers can build a real business on and have some degree of certainty. If you think about the offline world, like starting a restaurant, when you spend all this time and money, you can still run your restaurant even if the landlord jacks up the rent. That\u0027s what we have today: essentially five big landlords that appreciably change the rules and change rents. That\u0027s created a very inhospitable environment for independent developers and startups.\n\nIn the venture capital business, we invest in startups. We want to see a dynamic internet that\u0027s hospitable to startups. One of the reasons I\u0027m excited about blockchains, is because I see them as a way to return us to predictable platforms, where entrepreneurs and creators can build direct relationships with their audiences. This is what the internet was supposed to be. I really worry that the way we\u0027re headed now, there\u0027s going to be three or four big platforms like broadcast TV in the 70s — ABC, NBC, CBS. And everyone\u0027s going to spend their time in one of those silos. To me, that\u0027s a tragic outcome for what was once this open, democratic network. We should be doing all we can to counter that.\n\nAre you willing to say anything about Oculus? You’ve hinted in interviews in the past that you\u0027ve been sort of unsatisfied with how it\u0027s been managed by Meta.\n\nI made that investment for us back in November 2013. I\u0027m glad Facebook is invested in VR and about Apple investing in VR. They’ve done a good job generally, and spent an incredible amount of money. I am concerned that, similar to the themes I\u0027m talking about with the internet, we\u0027re going to end up with two new giant corporate platforms without an open-source alternative. There\u0027s no Linux of VR right now. They\u0027re both seemingly running the same strategy of a tightly controlled App Store with 30% payments, like the iOS ecosystem.\n\nI\u0027m very bullish on VR. I think it\u0027s going to be a big deal. I just worry we\u0027re going to keep repeating the same cycle. Everyone initially dismisses technology as a toy, then they suddenly wake up to the fact that two companies control a very important resource — like social media. We should put up the alarm bells earlier this time.\n\nOne of the major differences between Web1 and Web3 is the role of the government and academia developing the foundational internet protocols. Does Web3 need another DARPA like to succeed?\n\nI don\u0027t think so. There\u0027s enough sources of funding, that\u0027s not the shortcoming. We need more entrepreneurs, we need more academics, we need clear policy. Because many policy decisions are playing out in courts, and that takes many years; it creates uncertainty and disincentivizes entrepreneurs.\n\nWe want to be as inclusive as possible. If folks in academia and government want to get involved in a constructive way, that\u0027s awesome. Our research team, led by Tim Roughgarden, who is a professor at Columbia, and Dan Boneh, a professor at Stanford, write academic papers and do seminars — everything\u0027s open-source. We try to get more people involved. Unfortunately, there\u0027s just a ton of misunderstanding around the blockchain space, which is a big reason I wrote the book. There\u0027s a lot more skepticism than is warranted.\n\nYou write that software is more like fiction than anything, and have said that information wants to be free. Does this imply that fiction or other creative works should be priced at the level for commodity inputs or devalued broadly?\n\nI don’t think I said information wants to be free.\n\nIn previous interviews you\u0027ve suggested it.\n\nOkay, let me maybe add nuance. I don\u0027t know exactly what context I said it; I very strongly believe that creative people should be paid for their work. There’s a section in the book on the media business where I call attention to the attention monetization trade off, which is a trade-off in media between getting people to see what you do by sharing it on the internet and charging for it.\n\nThe video game industry is the most pioneering in that it has figured out it’s a better business to, instead of charging for the game, charge for compliments to the game like virtual goods. League of Legends and Fortnight, two of the most successful games, are free. I suspect, as AI enables anybody to create high-quality illustrations for free, that\u0027s gonna put downward pressure on the prices of illustrations. So it\u0027s more important than ever to think about new business models for creative people that don\u0027t involve simply, quote-unquote, selling the game. They sell other things.\n\nInformation can be free in the sense that content can be free, and creative people can still get paid. NFTs are an obvious example, right? How do artists get paid in the offline world? Artists don\u0027t get paid by copyrighting the image of a painting; they want that image to propagate and they sell the original paintings or photographs. They sell essentially the signed, authenticated version of the image, not the image itself. NFTs introduced a similar idea into the digital world. You can reconcile an internet where sharing content that drives the price of the content to zero with business models that make sure creative people get paid.\n\nNFTs help monetize work and build alternative revenue streams, but they don\u0027t necessarily fix the problems of distribution or building audiences. This is an idea that came up in your conversation with Bob Iger, who argued, if you have a brand identity, it doesn’t matter which technological medium you’re using to distribute work. Do you see potential solutions to this problem?\n\nI write about collaborative storytelling — where communities of people come together and create narrative worlds. Think of Star Wars, Harry Potter, but future versions of that. Creators work collaboratively, Wikipedia-style, to come up with storylines. You already see this happening on Reddit, where people critique Star Wars and suggest storylines. I read some of that stuff; people have really good ideas. Imagine those people got rewarded with NFTs and tokens that give them financial upside if the narrative world is successful? That also solves a distribution problem, right?\n\nHollywood only does sequels of existing IP because it costs hundreds of millions of dollars to market new IP. If you have a million fans who own tokens, who helped to create a narrative universe, they now have an incentive to evangelize that universe. You could fork Star Wars, create your own version of it. It\u0027s an internet-native way to create genuine fans with skin in the game. Think about how people get excited about bitcoin or meme coins or something and apply it to narrative storytelling to propagate and generate movies, video games and comics.\n\nA few higher profile hires left a16z. Why do you stay instead of going solo?\n\nWell, look, I\u0027ve been here for over a decade. Among other things, I\u0027m close to my partners Marc [Andreessen] and Ben [Horowitz]. What we\u0027re trying to do at the firm is kind of the best of both worlds: a bigger firm with a platform that helps us save on administrative overhead and use our business as a network to build relationships with Fortune 500 companies, limited partners and policymakers — all the different kinds of relevant constituents. At the same time, with our crypto fund, we were able to go really deep and vertical and bring experts onto our team.\n\nAre there any fundamental disagreements you have with Marc?\n\nWe argue in a very friendly way, and try to encourage a culture of healthy debate at the firm. The thing that we share that\u0027s the kind of uniting principle across the firm is we\u0027re “tech optimists.” I have been my whole life, frankly. It\u0027s important to recognize that all technology has pros and cons. You can use a hammer to build or destroy a house. We also believe smart regulation balances innovation and consumer safety. But we strongly believe technology is a force for good — and that\u0027s what we see as our mission. Furthermore, we believe that startups are an important part of technology, that new company formation has been an important part of the U.S. economic engine and we want to play a part in that. There aren\u0027t that many scaled institutions that are strongly pro tech and pro startup.\n\nSee also: Coinbase vs. the SEC Argues About Beanie Babies\n\nI agree in general that technology is neutral, but also that specific things are designed for harm. Do you at all disagree with the firm\u0027s investments in military technology?\n\nSilicon Valley has a long history of being both supported by and supporting the U.S. government. Our view generally is that we\u0027re pro-U.S. and its allies. We want to do what we can to support the U.S. government more and it\u0027s not our place to decide on foreign policy. We don\u0027t have our own State Department.\n\nYou describe blockchains as “near-Turing complete” computers whereas others often just call them Turing complete. Why split hairs?\n\nI have much smarter people on my team, computer scientists who get mad at me when I say Turing-complete. I think there\u0027s certain functions you can\u0027t do — recursion, random numbers, things you need oracles for. So I\u0027m just trying to be academically precise. You still have a very rich design space as a developer.\n\nYou said that the overreliance on advertising was the “original sin of the internet.” Advertising has paid for many wonderful things: a once-thriving newspaper industry; great TV, movies, stuff like that. Why is advertising uniquely poisonous on the web?\n\nI\u0027m not against all advertising, but the pendulum swung way too far towards advertising and it\u0027s resulted in an adversarial relationship between companies and users. You\u0027re getting tracked constantly. You click on a lawn mower and then forever, you see more and more ads for lawn mowers. Google defaults all my preferences without asking me, storing all my searches forever. And the argument that ads pay for free services: there are other ways beyond freemium. Most SAAS software works this way — Slack, Discord, Spotify, a lot of software.\n\nGames also have free tiers, and upsell you stuff. That\u0027s a way for them to essentially give away the software for free to [the] 95% of the users [who] won\u0027t pay for it. I probably play Clash Royale too much; it\u0027s a free game. But some percentage of the users, including me, end up buying upgrades that pays for everybody else. So I think there are other ways.\n\nFree software is a very important thing. And we want software in the hands of billions of people. But I don\u0027t think advertising is the only way to go. The two biggest pure internet services, Meta and Google, are fully ad-based.\n\nBut is there something unique about the architecture of the web that made advertising a problem?\n\nIt was just a historical thing. I mentioned in the book, but it took a long lot longer for payments to develop. First you needed encryption. People forget this but there was a very controversial technology introduced by Netscape, SSL [Secure Sockets Layer] encryption, that caused arguments over encrypted internet communications. E-commerce didn\u0027t exist, online banking didn\u0027t exist, and so it seemed as if the only potential users of it would be terrorists and criminals. That was a common argument. Netscape was classified as munitions and was illegal to export; they had to have a special version for international users.\n\nThere was also a big political debate in the 90s over the Clipper Chip, the Clinton administration chip that would have forced weak encryption on everybody. So, because it took a long time for encryption to develop, it took a long time for payments to develop, and advertising filled that void. And then it just sort of became the norm throughout the 2000s as social networking and search grew.\n\nOver the last decade, the pendulum has been swinging back very strongly. The vast majority of unicorns in the last 10 years have been paid services, enterprise software, prosumer software. But we\u0027re still overly reliant on advertising.\n\nThere’s a lot I wanted to touch on, would you maybe want to do a round of overrated/underrated?\n\nI\u0027m always gonna want to probably add nuance.\n\nFeel free definitely if something strikes. Web2 communities.\n\nYou mean like Reddit and Discord and all that?\n\nYeah, overrated/underrated?\n\nI think it\u0027s like I think the fact that we\u0027ve built a system where five billion people can all communicate and congregate around shared interests is a great thing. It\u0027s an amazing accomplishment, I\u0027m very pro.\n\nDirect democracy? You mean in DAOs or in the real world?\n\nEither, was thinking DAOs.\n\nI have a chapter in the book about network governance. It\u0027s an important direction to develop. Having community owned networks and digital services is a vast improvement over having corporate-owned networks and digital services. People are exploring new ways to do this governance, including through DAOs – from Uniswap and Compound. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s figured out yet, by the way. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s figured out in the real world either. If you talk to governance experts, it\u0027s a constant struggle to get large groups of people together to govern things in an orderly way, and I think we\u0027re seeing similar things in the online world.\n\nPoint systems for airdrops. Overrated/underrated?\n\nI think that\u0027s an ambiguous word. As I understand points, it\u0027s sort of non-transferable tokens people use in different ways. There\u0027s just a lot of people experimenting. There\u0027s also regulatory reasons why points might be advantageous. They clearly behave much more like Starbucks points, or more traditional rewards.\n\nCBDCs?\n\nI\u0027m not positive on those. What\u0027s happening with USDC, as an example; stablecoins show how popular digital dollars are, right? I mean, many trillions of dollars worth of transactions happen via stablecoins. There\u0027s been so much good work on the infrastructure layer, with L2s [layer 2s] and other blockchains, that I think the private sector will find high-quality technological solutions. Obviously, we need the use of dollars to be regulated. But that\u0027s different than having the government go and try to actually build the software.\n\nVC funding in crypto. Overrated, underrated?\n\nI mean — I know we get a lot of s**t on Twitter, but my view is, especially during the crypto winter… Let me tell you this, we started the first crypto fund beginning late 2017-18, and there just wasn\u0027t a lot of funding happening in crypto. We did the seed and Series A of Compound, did the Series A for Uniswap. We funded a bunch of NFT projects going back to I think 2017. I co-led the Series A of Dapper and CryptoKitties. So I just think that VC funding can play an important role in funding things. That might not be popular. The nature of VC funding is we have a very long term time horizon — 10 year funds — so we\u0027re able to fund things when other people aren\u0027t. That kind of persistence and commitment is sometimes overlooked, especially during boom times when funding is flowing. Of course, VC can mean a lot of things and there\u0027s a lot of different firms — some people call themselves VCs when they\u0027re really more like hedge funds or traders. But we roll up our sleeves, and I think play a valuable role in the startup ecosystem.\n\nSee also: If You\u0027re in Crypto, You\u0027re a Criminal\n\nYour fund at a16z operates autonomously. Say on a 10 year horizon, if crypto grows, do you see the Crypto Fund diversifying further to have specific multi billion dollar funds focused just on DeFi or blockchain social media?\n\nMy hope is for blockchain to become synonymous with new internet innovation. In that case, I don\u0027t know exactly how we would structure it, but if you analogize it to the internet in the 90s, there were internet funds and internet investors and then, over time, there were more focused consumer internet, fintech and enterprise investors. Ideally, that would happen here.\n\nThere\u0027s a million other questions I could ask, wish we had more time.\n\nHow do you like the book?\n\nI loved it, really. Maybe the best general introduction to crypto I’ve come across. Anything you wish I asked?\n\nMy hope is that crypto folks will like the book as much as you do. But really, I wanted a book that explains this all to the general public. There’s a big gap between why I\u0027m excited and the general public, which has a more negative view. So, I really hope it becomes the book that people like to give to their friends and family and say, “Hey, this is why I\u0027m excited.”\n\nWas it significantly different writing the book versus Twitter threads?\n\nI don\u0027t know if I fully understood what I was getting myself into. It was a ton of work. But it was gratifying and fun.\n\n",

    "title": "What Is Chainlink? A Beginner\u0027s Guide",
    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "Learn about Chainlink in 5 minutes with our beginner’s guide, which covers blockchain oracles, the oracle problem, and universally connected smart contracts.\n\n",
    "content": "Chainlink is the industry-standard Web3 services platform that has enabled trillions of dollars in transaction volume across DeFi, insurance, gaming, NFTs, and other major industries. As the leading decentralized oracle network, Chainlink enables developers to build feature-rich Web3 applications with seamless access to real-world data and off-chain computation across any blockchain and provides global enterprises with a universal gateway to all blockchains.\n\nWith cryptocurrency and blockchain technology gaining mainstream attention and Chainlink establishing itself as a key component of many blockchain applications, more people are entering the industry and asking the fundamental question: what is Chainlink?In order to help those new to blockchains, smart contracts, and oracles, we’ve created a simple overview to showcase the value of the Chainlink oracle network and how it enables blockchain technology to reach its full potential. This guide provides context on Chainlink by answering three key questions:To fully comprehend the importance of Chainlink, it’s critical to first understand the underlying value of blockchains and smart contracts. Generally, a blockchain is a decentralized network of computers that performs computation and stores data in a shared ledger. A blockchain differs from traditional, centralized computer systems in that:Blockchains achieve these properties by having thousands of computers run the same software, process the same transactions, store the same data, and consistently cross-check one another to reach consensus as a network about what is valid. All these network operations are backed by monetary incentives that reinforce honest behavior and consensus. By redundantly validating and storing transactions across a large decentralized network of financially incentivized participants, blockchains make it extremely expensive and impractical to manipulate the shared ledger.\n\nThus, blockchains are extremely secure and reliable systems for performing computation and storing data for processes involving two or more independent parties. The fundamental benefit of blockchains is that they mitigate counterparty risk—the risk that the other party in a contract won’t uphold their end of the agreement. For example, if someone wants to make a digital trade with a stranger, how do they decide who sends money first, whether they have enough funds, and that the funds can’t be spent twice (commonly known as the double spending problem)? Traditionally, users would employ a third party such as a payment processor or clearinghouse to facilitate the trade or arbitrate a dispute. However, a blockchain serves as a more reliable, tamperproof, and unbiased system for settling transactions. Users know that when they send a transaction to the blockchain, it will execute exactly as instructed.\n\nA blockchain’s decentralized architecture is why Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have emerged as such strong forms of money: users can trust that no central administrator will inflate the supply (capped at 21M BTC) and that the underlying Bitcoin blockchain showing who owns Bitcoin has been validated by thousands of computers across the world. Also, the decentralized design of the blockchain allows users to exchange value directly, “peer-to-peer”, removing custodial middlemen who can siphon off fees and censor transactions, ultimately allowing users to retain ownership over their assets and data.\n\nHowever, blockchains can support many use cases beyond simply moving and recording money on a ledger. Some highly programmable blockchains allow a more expressive set of commands, specifically through running applications on the network that trigger actions based on specific, predefined events (if x event happens, then execute y action). For example, if Flight 777 is canceled tomorrow, issue an insurance payout of $77; if not, then don’t make the payment. These blockchain applications, which can process a wider range of logic, are referred to as “smart contracts,” and have been the subject of much of the development around blockchains since Ethereum first introduced them at scale in 2015.\n\nThe problem is that a smart contract requires data (e.g. flight departure information) to execute commands, but most of the data it needs to digitize and automate real-world agreements is not stored on blockchains. The smart contract cannot fetch external data either, because blockchains are like black boxes with no built-in ability to connect with the outside world. This means that asset prices, sports scores, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, web data, enterprise systems, and the multitude of other real-world datasets are simply not available on the blockchain, severely limiting the types of smart contracts developers can create. How does one develop a flight insurance agreement without flight data?The only way to efficiently get data into the blockchain is for a software component called an “oracle” to input it into the blockchain. The challenge then becomes, how to design an oracle mechanism with the same security and reliability properties of the underlying blockchain so as to retain the underlying value proposition of the smart contract, e.g. extreme reliability without counterparty risk. If a single, centralized oracle is responsible for inputting the data used to trigger the smart contract, then that oracle has complete control over the smart contract’s outcome. This introduces a serious point of failure known as the oracle problem, which puts the entire smart contract at risk.\n\nChainlink, a decentralized oracle network, was developed to allow smart contracts to automate the transfer of data between blockchains and outside systems in a highly secure and reliable manner. It uses a similar model to a blockchain in that there is a decentralized network of independent entities (oracles) that collectively retrieve data from multiple sources, aggregate it, and deliver a validated, single data point to the smart contract to trigger its execution, removing any centralized point of failure.\n\nFor example, Chainlink provides the USD price of Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency ETH to blockchains via the ETH/USD Price Feed, which uses numerous independent oracle nodes and data sources to source and deliver the price data (pictured below). The ETH/USD price oracle can then be used by a blockchain application to get the current price of ETH when being used as collateral to obtain a loan or to settle a prediction made about the future ETH price.\n\nChainlink also provides multiple layers of security that go beyond decentralization to ensure users can trust the oracle network:By providing strong security and reliability guarantees on par with the blockchain, more advanced smart contracts are being created using Chainlink oracles. While we have already outlined 77 Smart Contract Use Cases Enabled By Chainlink, some of the main ones include:Many traditional financial products like loans, payments, derivatives, asset equity, and more are being built on the blockchain using smart contracts to increase their security and transparency and reduce barriers to entry. These DeFi applications use Chainlink to price assets, access interest rates, verify collateralization, and more, which enable these products to perform functions like issue a loan at fair market value, automate the issuance of dividends, and settle an options contract.\n\nSmart contracts are also being leveraged to create parametric insurance contracts on the blockchain. Chainlink is currently being used in production to provide weather data to the Arbol crop insurance market, enabling farmers all over the world to obtain parametric crop insurance simply with an Internet connection, which is settled in a fair and timely manner according to the amount of rainfall, temperature, or other evaluators the policy is set to (e.g. if it rains more than x amount this year, pay out y settlement).\n\nDevelopers are also beginning to launch smart contract-based gaming applications on the blockchain that often incorporate non-fungible tokens (NFT) as scarce digital collectibles. One of the key building blocks of many blockchain games is a source of randomness to generate random in-game scenarios or determine the lucky winner of prizes. Chainlink provides a randomness solution called VRF, which generates randomness and delivers it to the smart contract in a manner where users can prove it is fair and unbiased, as neither the players, game creators, or external entities can tamper with or manipulate the randomness to their advantage.\n\nAnother key use case of Chainlink is providing traditional systems like data providers, IoT networks, websites, and enterprises a way to make their data and services available to any blockchain network. Since the Chainlink Network is blockchain-agnostic, Chainlink oracles serve as an integration gateway for connecting current digital and data infrastructure to any/all blockchain networks. An industry-standard interoperability framework using oracle networks like Chainlink to connect traditional systems with blockchains was outlined in the recent World Economic Forum report co-authored by Chainlink Co-founder Sergey Nazarov titled Bridging the Governance Gap: Interoperability for Blockchain and Legacy Systems.\n\nThese are just some of the many capabilities Chainlink provides to allow smart contracts to interact with external data and systems with a high degree of security and reliability. The end result is the ability for blockchain-based smart contract applications to enable extensively more use cases across a more diverse set of markets.\n\nIf blockchains are decentralized computers and smart contracts are decentralized applications, then Chainlink can be thought of like a decentralized Internet that finally allows smart contracts to interact with the outside world while maintaining blockchain technology’s fundamental guarantees around security, transparency, and trust.\n\nIf you are new to blockchain technology and want to dive deeper, we recommend reading the following educational series in order:If you want something more technical, we encourage you to read the original Chainlink whitepaper, Chainlink 2.0 whitepaper, developer documentation, and browse through the Chainlink blog for a wide variety of resources.\n\nTo stay up-to-date with the latest news, follow the official Chainlink Twitter, and subscribe to the Chainlink newsletter.\n\n",

    "content": "Ethereum is the biggest playground for developing smart contracts in the existing blockchain landscape. Developers trust Ethereum as it was the first blockchain to introduce the benefits of smart contract programmability. The ideal programming language to create smart contracts on Ethereum is Solidity. It offers a wide range of features that help in development and implementation of smart contracts. However, you have to install Solidity compiler to deploy smart contracts according to your desired use case.\n\nEthereum developers must use a compiler to ensure that the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM can interpret and execute the commands in the code. In other words, the Solidity compiler facilitates conversion of the code to a set of byte instructions. Let us learn more about a Solidity compiler, how to install one, and the important Solidity compiler tools.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nSolidity is a popular programming language for creating smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain. It has gained significant improvements in popularity as the demand for web3, dApps, and smart contracts grows exponentially. Therefore, it is important to know about all the essential tools to create smart contracts with Solidity.\n\nThe answers to ‘What is Solidity compiler’ primarily focus on its nature as an open-source compiler that helps in translation of code in Solidity programming language to bytecode. It serves as the bridge for communication between developers and the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Solidity compiler ensures that the smart contract code follows the important rules and requirements associated with Ethereum blockchain.\n\nYou can come across two different types of Solidity compilers, such as solc and solc.js. The original version of Solidity compiler has been written in Go programming language. On the other hand, the fundamentals of Solidity compiler explained for beginners also emphasize how solc.js leverages Emscripten for compiling C++ code to JavaScript. The Node.js library, alongside the solcjs command line tool, helps to assemble Solidity files. Furthermore, it also uses JavaScript for compilation with the advantage of flexible installation.\n\nAre you aspiring to learn the fundamentals of the Ethereum Virtual Machine and smart contracts’ upgradability? Enroll now in the Advanced Solidity Development Course.\n\nThe working of smart contracts is a complicated process from a technical perspective. You can look at them as automated contracts that execute upon fulfillment of certain conditions. On the other hand, smart contracts depend on code to make everything possible. Developers write code in a language they can understand.\n\nHowever, machines must understand the smart contract code to execute them successfully. Compilation of smart contract code to bytecode is an important requirement to help the EVM understand the code. Bytecode primarily includes binary computer instructions and is deployed directly to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe process to compile Solidity code also leads to the generation of an Application Binary Interface or ABI. It serves as the interface between program modules, such as user programs and operating systems. The bytecode deployed on Ethereum blockchain is saved at a specific address that would be publicly available and allows everyone to interact with the smart contract.\n\nThe address represents the instance of a deployed contract and also offers persistent storage for the maintenance of internal state of the smart contract. Native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, ETH, offers a store of value and a trusted method of payment to facilitate execution of smart contracts on the blockchain.\n\nSolidity compiler is an integral part of the process of developing and implementing smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain. Before you dive into the practical aspects of using Solidity compiler, you must know about its special highlights. The important details of Solidity compiler you must learn to understand it effectively include Solidity compiler versions, plugins, settings, and APIs.\n\nSolidity compiler also offers flexibility in extending its functionalities with the help of plugins. Developers can use plugins to introduce new language features or for custom optimizations. Interestingly, you can write plugins in any programming language, such as Python and Rust, with the flexibility for seamless interfacing with Solidity compiler.\n\nAnother important detail about Solidity compiler invites attention to its settings. The answers to “What is Solidity Compiler” also draw attention towards the flexibility for configuration of control over compilation of Solidity code. The important Solidity compiler settings include the gas limit, the target EVM version, and the optimization level.\n\nYou can specify the version of the EVM with which the bytecode will be compatible. The gas limit allows you to specify the amount of gas required to execute bytecode on Ethereum. On the other hand, the optimization level represents the aggressiveness with which the Solidity compiler would refine the bytecode.\n\nThe distinctiveness of Solidity compiler versions ensures that every version comes with unique features as well as limitations. For instance, you might find compatibility for new features like ABIEncoderV2 in some versions of Solidity compiler. Developers have to choose the right Solidity compiler version according to the requirements of their smart contracts.\n\nYou can also find better prospects for using Solidity compiler with the help of APIs. Developers can use APIs to programmatically compile Solidity code from other applications. The APIs can help in creating tools like integrated development environments and code analyzers that empower the Solidity development workflow with automation.\n\nLearn about the concepts of Solidity programming and the best practices for creating tokens, NFTs, and dApps with Ethereum Technology Course.\n\nThe functionalities of Solidity compiler and its broad range of features prove how it is integral to smart contract development. You must learn how to install Solidity compiler before diving into smart contract development. One of the easiest methods recommended for installing a Solidity compiler is through Remix. You can use Remix online, albeit with certain limitations, such as limited options for compilation and support for small contracts only.\n\nIf you want to interact with larger smart contracts, then you have to go the other way. The alternative methods for installing Solidity compiler involve the use of Docker, macOS packages, Linux, static binaries, or npm/Node.js. Here is an overview of the different methods that can help you with the installation of Solidity compiler.\n\n\n\nMost of the guides on Solidity compiler explained the necessity of choosing Docker as a trusted tool for Solidity compiler installation. The process is simple: you have to download a Docker image that will do all the heavy lifting. The Docker image would run the compiler executable, thereby ensuring that it can accept compiler arguments. You can use the following command to pull the Docker image for Solidity compiler.\n\ndocker pull ethereum/solc\n\nYou can use the following command to verify the image.\n\nDevelopers can compile Solidity smart contract code on the host machine by utilizing the Docker image. The process involves mounting a local folder for input and output alongside specifying the details of the contract you have to compile.\n\nInstallation of Solidity compiler with binary packages involves the use of Linux and MacOS operating systems.\n\nIn the case of MacOS, you can rely on Homebrew for Solidity installation. The installation process offers access to macOS packages created from source and guides you through simple instructions. You can use the following commands to install Solidity on macOS devices.\n\nbrew update\n\nbrew upgrade\n\nbrew tap ethereum/ethereum\n\nbrew install solidity\n\nThe following command can help you verify the successful installation of Solidity and check the compiler version.\n\nIn the case of Linux, you can find a simpler procedure to install packages that would set up the Solidity compiler. It helps you set up different Solidity compiler versions according to your requirements within a few steps. The process begins with the addition of the following repository.\n\nNow, you can only update package list and complete the process by installing solc. You can also try the nightly build by changing the repository entry to “ethereum/ethereum-dev.”\n\nMaster the art of Smart Contract development with Solidity to create innovative web3 applications for diverse use cases as a Solidity expert with Solidity Skill Path.\n\nNPM or Node Package Manager is one of the common tools used to install Solidity compiler. Anyone who wants to know ‘what is Solidity compiler’ can begin their first practical experience with Solidity compiler through npm. It is a simple command-line tool that helps you with installation of Solidity compiler through simple steps. The following command helps in installing Solidity compiler across your system.\n\nSubsequently, you can verify the installation by checking the version of the Solidity compiler using the following command.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that installing Solidity with npm/Node.js presents some limitations. For example, the compiler would not have all the features of the standard Solidity compiler. It can only offer a reliable starting point for beginners.\n\nLearn about the fundamentals of smart contracts \u0026 solidity with Solidity \u0026 Smart Contracts E-Book\n\nThe different methods to install Solidity compiler must have made you feel confident about getting started with compilation of Solidity code. You can utilize the following code as an example to understand the process of compiling Solidity code.\n\nYou can compile the contract by using only the following line of code.\n\nOn top of it, you can also make the most of flexibility in choosing the specific EVM version for compilation. Here is the code to specify the EVM version for Solidity code compilation.\n\nThe fundamental details in a guide to Solidity compiler explained for beginners also draw the limelight towards Solidity decompiler. It is a tool that can compile smart contract EVM code in the form of input and then decompile it to generate Solidity source code. The primary objective of a decompiler is the verification and in-depth understanding of smart contract behavior.\n\nDevelopers can use a decompiler to debug smart contracts in scenarios where they cannot find the original code. However, it is also important to remember that most of the Solidity decompilers are successful only to an extent in decompiling complex contracts. Some of the popular examples of Solidity decompilers include Etherscan Online Decompiler, Ethervm.io, and JEB Decompiler.\n\nStart learning blockchain with world’s first Blockchain Career Paths with quality resources tailored by industry experts now!\n\nThe review of Solidity compiler fundamentals reveals crucial insights about their significance in the smart contract development process.

    "summary": "Attendees are cautiously optimistic about apparent regulatory and legislative changes, though not everyone is convinced.\n\n",
    "content": "AUSTIN, Texas – The biggest news this year at Consensus seems to be the political sea change happening in the Democratic party over crypto. While President Biden’s administration essentially carried over the same reluctant-to-the-point-of-being-nearly-hostile approach to crypto as its predecessor, ever since the bottoming out of the industry in 2022 (the year from crypto hell) it has been actively hostile. The easiest way to sum up Biden’s “whole of government” attempt to wrangle in the crypto industry is with the catchphrase Operation Choke Point 2.0, coined by VC Nic Carter to describe the apparent debanking of many crypto firms.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nThis is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.\n\nBut in a matter of weeks, this has changed. Beginning with the bipartisan vote in the House and Senate to repeal the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) much-maligned accounting bulletin (SAB121) and extending to yesterday’s reveal that the Biden administration is reportedly doing outreach to crypto firms in a late-stage attempt to hear what they have to say about what good crypto policy would look like, it has become (nearly) believable that brighter days are ahead on the political, regulatory and legislative fronts for the domestic crypto industry.\n\nSee also: The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis)\n\nThe feeling is in the air, probably because everyone appears to be voicing it out loud. For instance, yesterday on the Consensus stage, NYSE President Lynn Martin said that she doesn’t think that crypto will remain a “partisan” issue much longer. In the same way that stock and bonds are mostly apolitical, it doesn’t really make much sense to view crypto as inherently political (in fact, crypto may have a better case for actually being apolitical, given the technical design of protocols like Bitcoin).\n\nHowever, not everyone is in alignment here. For instance, a big name crypto lawyer who works for a red hot DeFi startup, who asked not to be named given the sensitivity of his work, said he doesn’t think Biden’s apparent change of heart is genuine. “He’ll likely revert back to course, if reelected,” he said. Asked whether he felt any weight off his shoulders at all, or whether his job has or will get any easier, under seemingly improving regulatory conditions, he said “absolutely not.” Today is the same as yesterday.\n\nAustin Campbell, a Columbia University business lecturer who is plugged into the D.C. circuit, echoed this idea when noting that the seemingly parallel change in Congress is not likely permanent. In fact, if you look at how the voting on the landmark Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) happened, it largely broke down on age lines. Though this in itself could be a positive, given that younger members of Congress are more likely to “get it,” and despite the fact that U.S. politics is a gerontocracy, the dinosaurs won’t rule the world forever.\n\nThis morning, Messari founder Ryan Selkis, who recently spoke with former President Trump at Mar-a-Lago Club, and Uniswap Labs chief lawyer Marvin Ammori, a longtime Democratic operative, actually debated the recent political machinations afoot on the Main Stage. Selkis’ main argument was that any easing up on crypto by the Democrats is largely a result of Trump capturing the “single issue” crypto vote, and that it should be treated as suspect. While Ammori argued that political changes don’t flip like a switch, and that things like SAB121 and FIT21 were the result of real bipartisan collaboration and successful crypto lobbying.\n\nSee also: Trump Widens Lead Over With Biden (on Polymarket and PredictIt) After Courting Crypto Vote\n\n“My point is, we don\u0027t necessarily want to be partisan, because that will be a setback in the long term,” Ammori said. In other words, crypto should be wary of aligning itself with any one party or any one candidate – especially considering that campaign promises are rarely kept. For his part, Selkis wanted to step out of wishful thinking (i.e., that Democrats could be suddenly supportive of crypto after so many years) and into the realm of realpolitik (i.e., that if the theory of bipartisan support were true, it’d be because Dems’ needs have shifted).\n\n“Democrats right now are like a cheating spouse; we caught them with their pants down,” Selkis said. “To reward this Democrat, mainstream party at this point in time is not only foolish, but I think it shows a profound lack of self-respect – they need to do penance.”\n\n",

    "content": "Machine learning is one of the most promising branches of science that has come into existence in recent times. Although the concept of machine learning is in its initial phase, it has shown immense potential as well as promise. Today, machine learning has made its presence in diverse areas such as image recognition, fraud detection, self-driving cars, recommender systems, and many more. If you wish to understand the true potential of machine learning, you need to focus on machine learning work that takes place at a deeper level.\n\nAre you curious to know how machine learning work? If yes, you will get an answer to the question pretty soon. However, before learning about the working of machine learning, you should have a clear understanding of machine learning. It can help to strengthen your foundation on the subject. In case you are feeling overwhelmed by learning about machine learning, you do not have to feel nervous. The simple steps will help you grasp the machine-learning concept and the underlying machine-learning workflow in an effective manner.\n\n\n\nMachine learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. It fundamentally focuses on the creation of computer algorithms that improve via experiences as well as the application of data. The ML technology allows computer systems to learn from data. Moreover, Machine Learning enables them to make predictions or decisions without having to explicitly program them.\n\nIn the central position of ML, the key is to create and implement algorithms. These algorithms are responsible for facilitating decisions and predictions. The role of the algorithms is of high importance since they enhance their performance with time. Hence, as time passes and more data is processed, the accuracy and precision of decisions and predictions get better. In current times, when technology is evolving rapidly, the function of machine learning is considered to be of immense value. By imitating the learning process in human beings’ machine learning, the level of accuracy is strengthened.\n\nTake your first step towards learning about artificial intelligence through AI Flashcards\n\nBefore diving into the steps that arise in the context of Machine Learning, you need to learn about the main machine learning methods. The insight will help you at a later stage, especially while guiding your ML model. There are two different machine learning methods that you can use: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.\n\nIn the machine learning context, supervised learning is among the most common machine learning methods. This is because it deals with tasks and activities that are straightforward. The labeling of data inputs is done with the answers that the algorithm has to arrive at. Hence, the machine is able to pick patterns gradually, which supports better data differentiation and assists in making predictions. It is possible to compare this method to a technique where a test is given to an individual, and they are also provided with an answer key.\n\nUnsupervised learning is the machine learning method in which a model gets to learn something organically. This is possible because there is no explicit instruction that the model can follow in order to arrive at the outcome. As a result, the model automatically attempts to locate structure and pattern in raw data by conducting analysis as well as interpretations.\n\nIt is true that supervised learning is simpler and easier than unsupervised learning. However, one may not have access to comprehensive data to train the algorithm. In such a scenario, one has to rely on unsupervised learning. Now that you have a better understanding of machine learning and different machine learning methods, it is time to answer the question – how does machine learning work?\n\nIdentify new ways to leverage the full potential of generative AI in business use cases and become an expert in generative AI technologies with Generative AI Skill Path\n\nIn order to understand how does machine learning work, it is essential to adopt a methodical approach; the step-by-step will help you to understand each of the processes in a detailed manner. The entire machine learning work process has been broken down into simple steps so that you can grasp it in detail. Follow the simple steps to become proficient in how Machine Learning technology works:\n\nThe basic step in machine learning involves the collection of data. Undoubtedly, the data collection process is the core of the machine learning workflow. Moreover, while collecting data, it is essential to prioritize the quality as well as the quantity of data. This is because these characteristics of data can have a direct implication on the performance of the machine learning model. It is a key process that is the foundation for the subsequent processes.\n\nYou can use a number of sources to collect data. Some of the common sources are text files, databases, audio files, images, and many more. After data gathering is complete, you need to shift your attention towards preparing it for ML.\n\nThe second stage in machine learning workflow involves the preprocessing of data. It is one of the most important steps, and it involves data cleaning, handling of missing data, and normalizing of data. Data preprocessing is necessary since it can enhance the quality of data. Moreover, it can make sure that your machine learning model is able to make interpretations accurately.\n\nWhen it comes to the working of machine learning, one of the most crucial steps is the selection of the model. There is a broad range of machine learning models that you can choose from, such as linear regression, neural networks, decision trees, and many more,\n\nThe model that you ultimately choose depends on the nature of the data that you have gathered. The problem that you plan to solve may also come into play and influence the model that you choose. Choosing the appropriate model, you need to focus on factors such as the data type, the data size, and the complex nature of the problem.\n\nEnroll in our Certified ChatGPT Professional Certification to master real-world use cases with hands-on training.

Training fundamentally involves feeding the data into the machine learning model. Furthermore, it also involves making adjustments to the internal parameters so that better predictions can be made.\n\nWhen it comes to machine learning work, one of the key things to keep in mind revolves around the evaluation of the model. After the training is complete, you need to evaluate it. This step is crucial to check its performance before its actual deployment. Basically, you need to test the model by using new data. You can use certain metrics to check its performance, such as accuracy and precision.\n\nWhen it comes to the working of machine learning, it is essential to focus on proper tuning of the parameters. It is important to make adjustments to the parameters of the model. It can directly impact the function of machine learning. This process is commonly known as parameter tuning in machine learning. You can use a number of techniques for the same, such as cross-validation and grid search.\n\nThe final step that you need to know how does machine learning work involves making predictions and deployment. After all the steps have been correctly executed, the model should be able to make predictions correctly. You need to feed new data into the ML model to see how well it can make predictions. It is a crucial step that you cannot ignore at any cost. Once you are certain about the accuracy of the predictions, it is ready for the final deployment.\n\nWant to understand the importance of ethics in AI, ethical frameworks, principles, and challenges?

    "content": "On-chain data shows that the Bitcoin price reiterates the last cost basis level associated with the short-term holder group.\n\nAs explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, Bitcoin has only one Realized Price of the short-term holders left to break. The “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the average cost basis of the investors in the BTC market.\n\nInvestors carry net profits when the cryptocurrency’s spot price is above this level. On the other hand, it being under the metric suggests the dominance of losses in the market.\n\nIn the context of the current discussion, the Realized Price of the entire market isn’t of interest but rather that of a small segment of it. The group in question is a section of the “short-term holders” (STHs), broadly including the investors who bought their coins within the past six months.\n\nBelow is the chart that shows the trend in the Realized Price specifically for the STHs who have been holding since between one and three months ago:\n\nThis segment of the STHs sits right in the middle of the group, between the newcomers who have just bought into the asset and those who have started to gain some resilience, with a promotion into the long-term holder (LTH) group potentially coming up for them.\n\nAccording to the analyst, Bitcoin has already surged past the Realized price of the other two parts of the STH group, meaning that the investors falling in them would be in profits now.\n\nThe chart shows that the Realized Price of the 1 month to 3 months old investors, the one level BTC is yet to break, is valued at $67,100. This cryptocurrency price is currently floating around, suggesting that this cohort’s profits are canceling their losses.\n\nThe STH cost basis levels have historically been relevant for the cryptocurrency, as these investors, who are generally fickle-minded, are likely to show some reaction when the price retests their cost basis.\n\nIn bullish periods, these investors tend to buy at their own cost, while if the atmosphere is bearish, they may sell instead. As such, a successful break above this potential resistance boundary that Bitcoin is retesting right now could indicate the presence of bullish sentiment among the STHs.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,200, up almost 6% over the past week.\n\n",

    "content": "One can now find standardized, specific blockchain apps on a permissioned blockchain platform for the financial sector. Meet LedgerConnect, a dedicated financial blockchain-specific app store launched by the enterprise software leader International Business Corp. (IBM) in partnership with Barclays PLC (BCS) and Citigroup Inc. (C) and CLS, a foreign exchange market infrastructure firm.\n\nAmid the growing infrastructure of both public and private blockchains, the increasing number of blockchain-based applications provides the necessary support in the development of the distributed ledger technology (DLT) ecosystem. (See also: Public, Private, Permissioned Blockchains Compared.)While more and more banks and financial institutions are adapting to blockchain technology, there appears a need for utilizing it across a larger range of business activities. They may include basic data storage processes like know your customer (KYC) requirements to complex tasks like trade settlement. A large number of blockchain startups and technology companies are offering various DLT products, and a few major banks are working on developing their own. It is leading to a situation where multiple blockchains exist in their own silos with each having its own distinct offerings, but many fail to offer compatibility with other systems.\n\nThe Need for Interoperability\n\nTo draw a parallel, compare it with mobile phones of the early 2000 era, where each manufacturer would offer its own set of features and applications on their phones. In came the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, platforms that allowed developers to build compatible apps that could be installed on the respective phone’s operating systems allowing for seamless utility and connectivity.\n\nLedgerConnect is emerging as a similar platform—call it a blockchain app store, where various financial institutions will be allowed to access various DLT-based services for their needs and business process. It will act like the central hub to fill up the connectivity and compatibility void that exists in the present-day adoption of the blockchain technology by the financial industry. Hosted on a single, permissioned blockchain network and expected to act as a one-stop shop for the financial sector’s blockchain needs, LedgerConnect will facilitate the creation, hosting and usage of the various blockchain applications in a standard format targeting the financial industry. While all the currently hosted apps are Hyperledger-based, LedgerConnect founders are open to other enterprise blockchain solutions joining the app store.\n\n\"Having a secure network and proven infrastructure allows an app store kind of model, where banks can identify applications from certified fintech and software providers and deploy these apps over a seamless blockchain network,\" said Keith Bear, IBM\u0027s vice president for financial markets, to CoinDesk.\n\nThe DLT platform is not widely available yet, but IBM said it could be following completion of a successful proof of concept, regulatory approvals and sufficient market demand, reports CNBC.\n\n",

    "summary": "Bitcoin\u0027s fortunes may have dipped, but career prospects for those working in the blockchain industry are on an upswing.\n\n",
    "content": "In recent times, blockchain has become a magic word for organizations, who are applying the technology to solve complex problems. Some of that magic seems to be rubbing off on career prospects for those working in the industry.\n\nThere are numerous data points which testify to the growing demand and salaries for blockchain developers. Glassdoor, a jobs review site, found that demand for blockchain-related jobs this year increased by 300 percent as compared to last year. New York accounted for the maximum number of openings in the technology followed by San Francisco and San Jose. Chicago and Seattle rounded out the top five. Upwork, a site for freelancers, stated that demand for freelancers with a “blockchain” asset grew by 3,500 percent this year as compared to last year.\n\nThe skyrocketing demand for blockchain-related jobs has also translated into a significant salary bump. Online jobs site Hired told CNBC that average salary for blockchain developers is between $150,000 and $175,000 – a range that is approximately $15,000 to $40,000 higher than the standard salary for software engineers. That salary range puts blockchain developers on par with another in-demand group – engineers with expertise in artificial intelligence.\n\nAs a skill set, blockchain is a combination of existing programming technologies and concepts, such as object-oriented programming and ledger economics, with an understanding of cryptography. As such, demand for other roles, such as product managers and requirements specialists, within the industry is also growing.\n\nWhat’s Behind The High Salaries For Blockchain Developers?\n\nHigh salaries for workers in blockchain are a function of increased demand and short supply.\n\nWhile blockchain’s benefits are still unproven, breathless media coverage has ensured that the technology is on everyone’s radar. Established firms have embraced blockchain and announced initiatives specifically related to the technology. For example, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) has started a blockchain-as-a-service (BAAS) platform within Azure, its cloud division. IBM Corp. (IBM) has also launched a division dedicated to blockchain, basing it on an open-source fabric Hyperledger. Even social media behemoth Facebook Inc. (FB) has formed a group to explore blockchain’s uses in its business. A shortage in skills supply has helped further inflate salaries for blockchain experts. Several new initiatives are being launched to plug the gap in supply, from bounty programs to encourage developers to boot camps introducing the technology to developers. Universities are also in on the game and have launched online courses to educate professionals.\n\n",

    "content": "Marathon Digital (MARA), one of the largest Bitcoin (BTC) mining companies, has recently announced a substantial acquisition of $100 million worth of Bitcoin.\n\nThis significant purchase, detailed in a recent company statement, has increased Marathon’s Bitcoin holdings to over $1 billion at current prices, showing the company’s confidence in the future price appreciation of the largest cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nAccording to the company’s announcement on Thursday, by adopting a “HODL” strategy, Marathon has committed to retaining all Bitcoin mined through its operations, coupled with periodic strategic purchases on the open market.\n\nFred Thiel, the Chairman and CEO of Marathon Digital, expressed notable confidence in Bitcoin’s prospects in the wake of this latest acquisition as a long-term store of value. Thiel noted:\n\nWe believe Bitcoin is the world’s best treasury reserve asset and support the idea of sovereign wealth funds holding it. We encourage governments and corporations to all hold bitcoin as a reserve asset.\n\nThe announcement also included statements from Salman Khan, Marathon’s Chief Financial Officer, who highlighted the company’s renewed focus on growing its Bitcoin holdings and highlighted the favorable market conditions driven by increased institutional support and a positive macroeconomic environment:\n\n…We are once again implementing this strategy and focusing on growing the amount we hold on our balance sheet. Bitcoin’s recent price decline, coupled with the strength of our balance sheet, afforded us an opportunity to add to our holdings. We look forward to continuing to leverage our technological expertise to support Bitcoin and distributed digital asset ecosystems.\n\nIn the wake of this announcement, Marathon Digital has experienced a notable surge in its stock performance, with a 42.6% increase over the past six months, outpacing industry averages.\n\nAccording to recent reports, this upward trend in stock value can be attributed to Marathon’s mining efficiency and strategic expansion into mining another cryptocurrency called Kaspa (KAS), a diversification initiative aimed at bolstering the company’s revenue streams.\n\nMarathon believes its strategic diversification into Kaspa mining will further increase its revenues and profitability by leveraging the high margins associated with this digital asset.\n\nFurthermore, despite BTC mining challenges stemming from the Bitcoin Halving, Marathon outperformed its peers by mining 590 BTC at a “commendable daily rate.”\n\nAt the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has fallen back to the $64,700 mark, down over 2% in the 24-hour time frame, after failing to break above the $68,000 zone following BTC’s recovery from a six-month low of $53,500 on July 5.\n\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Following the SEC charges against the world’s largest crypto exchange, people are wondering what’s the difference between Binance and Binance.us, who is Changpeng Zhao and more.\n\n",
    "content": "Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao, who is often referred to as just “CZ,” Binance is the world\u0027s leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume as of June 2023. The company was originally based in China but had to leave Shanghai due to regulatory restrictions shortly after its launch.\n\nBinance developed its own blockchain, Binance Smart Chain (later renamed to BNB Chain), which facilitates trades on the exchange. The native token of the blockchain is Binance coin (BNB) and the company has also launched a stablecoin, BinanceUSD (BUSD). Because of U.S. regulatory rules, Binance created a supposedly separate company for its U.S. clients in 2019, Binance.US.\n\nOn June 5, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Binance.US as well as CZ, who serves as Binance CEO, on allegations of violating federal securities laws by offering BNB and BUSD to the general public, calling them unregistered securities. The SEC lawsuit also casts fresh doubt on the independence of the company’s U.S. arm and its staking service.\n\nRead more about the SEC suit here\n\nThis is not Binance’s first battle with U.S. regulators. Binance is also under ongoing scrutiny from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) who sued CZ and Binance in March 2023, alleging the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about Binance, Binance.US and CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao.\n\nCZ is a well-known personality in crypto, actively engaging with the crypto community through Twitter and speaking at conferences and to the media. As for his origins, he was born in China and emigrated to Canada when he was 12 and says he is a Canadian citizen. In high school, he worked part-time at McDonald’s, which is part of his well-known lore. He graduated from McGill University with a degree in Computer Science.\n\nAfter college, he worked for the Tokyo stock exchange and Bloomberg Tradebook developing software for the businesses. He then founded a startup in 2005, Fusion Systems, which focused on creating an automated high-frequency trading platform. Following that, he worked for several crypto startups including a stint as co-founder and CTO of OKCoin. Another piece of the CZ lore is that he first heard about Bitcoin at a poker game, which planted the seed that led him to create his own cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.\n\nAccording to the white paper, Zhao\u0027s goal for Binance was to compete with other exchanges by offering solutions to the numerous problems he saw with the cryptocurrency trading infrastructure – including poor technical architecture, insecure platforms, low market liquidity, poor customer support and poor language support.\n\nShortly after Binance’s 2017 launch, Binance raised $15 million through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for BNB, the terms of which were also laid out in the white paper.\n\nBinance started as one big company, founded in Shanghai in 2017. Because of China’s crackdown on crypto, the company left shortly after and while there were efforts to relocate the headquarters to Singapore and Malta was once thought to be Binance’s base, CZ currently claims that Binance has no headquarters and that wherever he is, that is where Binance is based.\n\nBinance also has a native coin, Binance Coin (BNB), which was initially launched on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token and subsequently migrated to Binance\u0027s proprietary blockchain, BNB Chain. BNB functions as an exchange token, meaning holders of BNB with Binance accounts can access discounted fees on the exchange.\n\nBinance created Binance.US in 2019 in response to regulatory requirements in the United States and notified customers that their accounts would be required to migrate to the new U.S-based exchange in November 2020. That said, many people noted that by using a VPN service, U.S.-based customers could still use Binance’s services.\n\nOne of the biggest differences between the two exchanges is that Binance.com offers a much wider range of cryptocurrencies, with over 500 available for trading. Binance.US offers over 120 cryptocurrencies and is not available in all states as of writing, with Hawaii, New York, Texas, and Vermont blocking use of the exchange.\n\nThe other big difference is that Binance.US does not offer margin trading or futures contracts, while Binance does. Both platforms offer low fees.\n\nFinally, unlike Binance’s stance that it has no headquarters, the U.S. arm is clearly based in Palo Alto, California. The SEC suit is specifically against Binance.US and Zhao and not the larger exchange.\n\nJuly 2017: Binance launches and raises $15 million through its BNB ICO.\n\nJuly 2018: Binance acquires Trust Wallet, a free, non-custodial mobile wallet to support its upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) offering.\n\nJanuary 2019: Binance starts to offer support for new token listings through ICOs (initial coin offerings) and IEOs (initial exchange offerings), through its Launchpad product.\n\nApril 2019: Binance migrates BNB from Ethereum to its proprietary chain, then called Binance Smart Chain (now rebranded to Binance chain or BNB chain)\n\nApril 2019: Binance launches its DEX ahead of schedule.\n\nMay 2019: Binance gets hacked for the first time. Hackers steal over 7,000 bitcoin (BTC) from Binance (the equivalent of roughly $41 million at the time). Zhao quickly took to social media to reassure users that no one lost funds and that Binance used its reserve funds to cover the costs of the stolen crypto. CZ\u0027s \"Funds are #SAFU\" tweet has become a meme in the crypto space.\n\nJune 2019: Binance announces it will launch a new trading platform for U.S. customers, in partnership with a firm called BAM Trading Services.\n\nJuly 2019: Binance hires former Ripple executive, Catherine Coley, to run its planned U.S. marketplace.\n\nSeptember 2019: Binance launches its own dollar-backed stablecoin, BUSD in partnership with the Paxos Trust Company.\n\nSeptember 2019: Binance.US launches in 37 states. The new marketplace supports six cryptocurrencies at launch: bitcoin, (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), tether (USDT) and BNB. BUSD is notably not supported at launch.\n\nApril 2020: Binance buys CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency data provider, for a rumored $400 million, making it one of the biggest M\u0026A deals in crypto. “CoinMarketCap has more users than any other product in the crypto space,” Zhao said at the time. “It’s a very valuable platform.”\n\nSeptember 2020: Binance rolls out Launchpool, a crypto staking platform.\n\nNovember 2020: Binance notifies U.S. customers they have a hard deadline of two weeks to migrate to the new platform before Binance shutters their accounts.\n\nApril 2021: Binance.US hires Brian Brooks as CEO to replace Catherine Coley in the role.\n\nAugust 2021: Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks quits over “strategic differences” after just months in the job.\n\nSeptember 2021: Binance.US promotes Brian Schroder to CEO; he formerly served as president and board member for the firm.\n\nApril 2022: Binance.US raises $200 million in its first funding round, giving it a $4.5 billion valuation.\n\nSeptember 2022: Binance announces it will stop supporting the second-largest stablecoin USDC and automatically convert customer funds to BUSD.\n\nOctober 2022: Binance suffers another major hack, and had to briefly halt trading on BNB after a “potential exploit” drained $100 million in crypto.\n\nOctober 2022: Binance confirms it has contributed $500 million towards Elon Musk’s bid to buy Twitter.\n\nNovember 2022: Amidst the collapse of FTX, there was a brief moment when Binance was going to buy the rival exchange. That deal quickly collapsed as the scope of FTX’s issues came to light.\n\nDecember 2022: Binance.US reaches an agreement to buy Voyager Digital\u0027s assets for just over $1 billion. Voyager, had gone into bankruptcy earlier in 2022 and originally had agreed to sell its assets to FTX, which folded itself.\n\nFebruary 2023: BUSD issuer Paxos is hit with a one-two punch of an investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services and a Wells Notice from the SEC, which some believed hinted at Binance as a future target for the SEC. Following these actions, Paxos halted minting BUSD.\n\nMarch 2023: The CFTC sues CZ and Binance over allegations that the company offered unregistered crypto derivatives products.\n\nApril 2023: Rumors of an Interpol “Red Notice” for CZ tank BNB price, but there is little to back up the claim.\n\nApril 2023: Binance.US pulls out of a $1 billion deal to buy Voyager Digital’s assets, attributing the termination to the \"hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.\"\n\nJune 2023: The SEC files charges against Binance.US and its founder Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao on allegations of violating federal securities laws with BNB token and Binance-linked BUSD stablecoin. The suit also alleges that Binance\u0027s staking service violated securities law as well as that the entities of Binance.US and Binance were not truly independent.\n\n",

    "summary": "Bitcoin is experiencing increasing bearish pressure, with technical indicators suggesting a potential decline toward the $63,316 mark.\n\n",
    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is currently experiencing increasing bearish pressure, with technical indicators suggesting a potential decline toward the $63,316 mark. This price drop is driven by factors such as weakening momentum and decreasing trading volume.\n\nAs Bitcoin targets the $63,316 mark, Investors and analysts are closely monitoring this development, as it may indicate further declines and set the stage for BTC to test lower support levels. This article analyzes Bitcoin’s current price movements and technical indicators signaling a potential further decline for the cryptocurrency focusing on the 4-hour and the 1-day chart.\n\nBitcoin currently has a market capitalization exceeding $1.3 trillion and a trading volume surpassing $39 billion. As of the time of writing, its price was down by 3.81%, trading around $66,814 over the last 24 hours. During this period, the asset’s market cap has decreased by 3.84%, while its trading volume has surged by 70.25%.\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, the price of BTC looks bearish as it is currently dropping towards the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). It can also be observed here that Bitcoin’s price has printed multiple bearish candlesticks as it approaches the $63,316 support level.\n\nThe Composite Trend Oscillator on the 4-hour chart further indicates a bearish trend, as both signal lines have fallen below the indicator’s SMA and are heading toward the zero level. If the price continues to decline as the indicator suggests, it could drop below the 100-day SMA, potentially reaching the $63,316 mark.\n\nA closer examination of BTC’s movement on the 1-day chart shows that the failure to break above the 1-day trendline has led to a significant price drop toward the 100-day SMA and the $63,316 support level. This has resulted in Bitcoin successfully printing a bearish candlestick in the previous day’s trading.\n\nAdditionally, the 1-Day composite trend oscillator indicates a potential bearish decline, as the signal line is currently attempting to cross below the indicator’s SMA. If this crossover is successful, it could lead to further losses for the crypto asset.\n\nShould the digital asset’s price fall below the 100-day SMA and the $63,316 mark, it may continue to drop to test the $60,152 support level. When this level is breached, BTC may experience more price drops toward the $53,541 support range and possibly other levels below.\n\nHowever, given that Bitcoin fails to decline further as predicted and turns to move upward, it will begin to move toward the $71,909 resistance level. It could move even higher to challenge the $73,811 resistance point if it breaks above $71,909 and possibly moves on to create a new all-high.\n\n",

The frameworks help simplify the process of creating and deploying neural networks. As a result, engineers and researchers can focus on the more complicated tasks. Here are the top ten frameworks that would shape the present and future of deep learning.\n\nPyTorch is a popular Python library that helps in development of deep learning projects for tasks like natural language processing and computer vision. It is a prominent addition to the deep learning framework list with two formidable features. First of all, it uses Tensor computing, which offers the advantage of better acceleration through GPU.\n\nOn the other hand, deep neural networks can also be developed over a tape-based automatic differentiation system. You can also find Optim and nn modules with PyTorch that serve distinct functionalities such as optimization algorithms, defining computational graphs, and making gradients.\n\nCaffe or Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding is another deep learning framework that has gained popularity in the AI landscape. It is one of the notable responses to “Which framework is best for deep learning?” for computer vision tasks, such as image classification.\n\nCaffe also supports different deep learning architectures, such as fully connected neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks. It was integrated into PyTorch and still remains a preferred choice for computer vision and different deep-learning projects.\n\n\n\nThe Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, or CNTK, is also a popular deep learning framework that offers easier training. It is an open-source framework that can effectively train convolutional neural networks for text, image, and speech-based data. CNTK is the best deep learning framework for implementing reinforcement learning models and Generative Adversarial Networks.\n\nThe most impressive feature of CNTK is the assurance of better scalability and performance when they run on multiple machines. However, it is still limited in terms of mobile compatibility capabilities due to a lack of support for ARM architecture.\n\nAnother popular addition among DL frameworks, MX Net, has gained popularity for offering better efficiency, flexibility, and productivity. It offers compatibility with C++, Python, and R. Most important of all, MX Net sits among the most popular deep learning frameworks with features for distributed training.\n\nThe framework offers efficient non-linear scaling that makes the best use of the resources. Users can enjoy the flexibility of training their deep learning models in any programming language they want.\n\nThe list of open-source frameworks for deep learning must also draw attention towards Chainer. It is one of the top deep learning frameworks with an intuitive and flexible library for managing dynamic computation graphs.\n\nTherefore, it is a useful tool for rapid experimentation and prototyping. Interestingly, it is one of the first frameworks to embrace the define-by-run approach. The easy-to-use API, alongside support for different deep learning networks, makes Chainer a favorable pick for deep learning projects.\n\nIdentify new ways to leverage the full potential of generative AI in business use cases and become an expert in generative AI technologies with Generative AI Skill Path\n\nTheano is also a notable open-source DL framework with features for effective evaluation and modification of mathematical expressions. It was developed with Python using syntax similar to NumPy.\n\nTheano is a mandatory addition to any deep learning framework list as it can serve different tasks, such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Apart from offering support for different deep learning networks, Theano also serves tools that can help with debugging and visualization.\n\nYour search for the answers to “Which framework is best for deep learning?” would obviously lead you to TensorFlow before any other framework. The open-source and free framework for machine learning has also evolved as a deep learning framework.\n\nDevelopers can use TensorFlow to create massive neural networks by leveraging data flow graphs to include different layers.\n\nIf you are looking for DL frameworks to help you with large-scale training, then GGML might be the best option for you. The open-source tensor library supports complex deep-learning models and works best for high-performance computing.\n\nIt has been developed using C and offers compatibility with different platforms alongside improving training speed with limited memory requirements.\n\nAnother prominent DL framework you would come across in 2024 is Keras. As an open-source framework, it continuously evolves, and its features make it more interesting for users. For example, it offers a Python interface to develop artificial neural networks. It is the best deep learning framework with a simple and easy-to-use interface.\n\nOne of the significant features of Keras is the ability to scale to large GPU clusters or complete TPU pods. In addition, the functional API of Keras supports models featuring a non-linear topology, multiple inputs or outputs, and shared layers.\n\nThe final addition to a collection of DL frameworks would be Scikit-learn, which aims to offer effective deep learning tools. The primary goal of the library revolved around reaching better robustness and support for production systems. It focuses on resolving concerns such as code quality, documentation, ease of use, performance, and collaboration.\n\nThe interface of Scikit-learn is based on Python. However, c-libraries also offer promising advantages for performance in using arrays and matrices. Companies such as JP Morgan have been using Scikit-learn for better statistical analytics and linear algebra.\n\nBecome a master of generative AI applications by developing expert-level skills in prompt engineering with Prompt Engineer Career Path\n\nThe arrival of deep learning has enhanced the different practical applications of AI and machine learning. Deep learning empowers machines to think and reason like humans. However, the collection of the most popular deep learning frameworks available in the AI landscape right now can create confusion for developers, researchers, and data scientists. Interestingly, you can pick a combination of DL frameworks for your project according to your requirements. For example, beginners can go with user-friendly frameworks such as TensorFlow.\n\nAs you learn more about the other top deep learning frameworks, you can learn about the different factors that can help you choose a specific framework. Some of the important factors that might influence your choice of DL framework are the type of problem, the hardware you have, and the programming language you want to use.

    "content": "The former president and current Republican nominee for this year’s presidential election caused chatter in the crypto industry earlier this month after several reports said he would announce those plans at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville last weekend.\n\nHe did – partially – but he also told attendees that bitcoin stands for “freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control.”\n\nBut his views and plans don’t match up, the WSJ wrote.\n\n“Freedom from government isn’t what he’s proposing,” the op-ed states. “He wants all future bitcoin to be made in America, which is a limit on freedom and would require a much bigger electric grid since bitcoin mining is energy intensive.”\n\nThe editorial board also criticized his alleged plans to make the cryptocurrency a “strategic reserve asset,” which it claims is based on a proposal by Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.)\n\nAccording to the planned legislation, which Lummis announced at the conference, bitcoin could help hedge against rising inflation and foster the United States’ growth in the global financial system while also securing the U.S. dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency.\n\n“She says the government could reduce the national debt by investing in bitcoin,” the WSJ argued. “[...] If crypto currencies really are a libertarian vehicle to invest free from political vagaries, then they should trade on their own without government help.”\n\nTrump’s “sketchy plan” to make Lummis’ bill a reality if he indeed takes office in January echoes the many contradictions of the billionaire’s MAGA platform while also clashing with much of what crypto stands for, the op-ed said.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "As the U.S. electricity grid struggles with wide scale outages, crypto-powered demand response programs can save customers billions. These decentralized generative energy networks (or DeGEN) offer services valuable to customers and governments alike.\n\n",
    "content": "From Thomas Edison’s invention of the lightbulb to Thomas Savery’s invention of the steam engine, innovation in energy has been a core contributor to American success. But, while energy innovation is alive and well, preservation has fallen by the wayside.\n\nThe U.S. grid is as old as it’s ever been, with 70% of power lines now over the age of 25 years. Today the United States has more outages than any other country in the world, resulting in billions of dollars in losses. The 2021 power surges in Texas alone cost between $80bn and $130bn.\n\nThis op-ed is part of CoinDesk\u0027s new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.\n\nStill, reinvestment in electrical hardware hasn’t been one of the government’s priorities, as the U.S. instead spends trillions insourcing chip production in the face of a rising China.\n\nWith the government prioritizing spending on computational rather than electrical infrastructure, organizations have emerged that optimize existing energy capacity through demand-response programs and issuance of behavior-linked credits (like carbon credits). Demand responses programs are immediately deployed whenever the grid is under too much stress. They incentivize customers to shift electricity usage to times when electricity demand is lower and more plentiful. Typically, demand-response has been a manual process, coordinated through mailers and automated phone calls driving people to act.\n\nHowever, while demand-response programs have strong potential, their implementation to date has been insignificant. According to the U.S. EIA, demand-response programs save ~29 GwH a year, equivalent to ~$150mm in energy costs, or \u003c1/1,000,000 of total US energy consumption. The U.S. government has previously subsidized solutions to this problem of poor demand-response.\n\nOpower, with the government as its only client, sold to Oracle for ~$600m in 2016 after using mail slips to drive home-owners to use less energy and saved \u003e$3bn in energy costs. Opower was a manual solution, teaching people about their usage habits and encouraging changes, but it didn’t solve the underlying issues with the grid that made demand-response a nightmare to organize. The difficulty comes down to two factors: lack of data availability, and lack of control to remotely modify energy usage.\n\nDemand-response is constrained by available data and by the rate at which people respond to physical incentives. Energy data exists in silos maintained by the 3000+ energy utilities in the U.S. As these companies generally operate on Excel spreadsheets, it is extremely difficult to establish metrics around real-time energy consumption, and therefore challenging to respond quickly. In addition, a response would require active engagement on the part of the household to respond to the call and optimize their energy use. If nobody is home, no action is taken.\n\nTo the problem of data availability, blockchains present a perfect solution. Distributed ledgers can unify energy data across utilities to create a baseline health map for the U.S. energy grid. This would allow utilities to securely store their own data, but also share that data with other utilities and the government without revealing private information. However, it’s unlikely these sleepy monoliths will drive this improvement themselves: utilities earn an annual fixed 10% return on equity from the government annually and aren’t well incentivized to innovate.\n\nThankfully, a large-scale transformation is afoot on the hardware side: rapid growth of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) like solar panels and charging stations has created the opportunity to rebuild the U.S. energy grid and incorporate powerful new technology. Alongside DERs, new interconnected networks of energy resources are emerging using blockchain and crypto to increase data availability and coordination. Examples include networks like Srcful, Daylight, and dClimate, and Glow: they use sensors to directly integrate with solar panels/batteries and create a real-time data layer mapping usage of energy nationwide. For some like Glow, they can use that data layer to let people create their own carbon credits: for others like dClimate, that data layer powers powerful prediction models enabling extremely accurate forecasts.\n\nOthers like Srcful and Daylight use the data layer to introduce programmability – in addition to sensors reporting on energy usage, they can also regulate it. Smart home applications today let users control energy usage remotely, allowing them to control their home lights from the office as an example. This new infrastructure will facilitate multiple new products that create unique economic value. With a real-time data layer and virtual control of appliances in place, companies like Srcful can build automated demand-response functions that activate instantaneously, rewarding users in stablecoins or cryptocurrency for their delegating control. Because the data layer verifies energy saving/optimization in real time, it is monetizable through municipal governments: Srcful as an example is the first in this category to receive a grant from the Swedish Energy Authority.\n\nWith smart home applications proliferating alongside a blockchain-managed data layer, all the pieces are in place to create large-scale demand-response programs. These decentralized generative energy networks (DeGEN) create a programmable, mappable grid that benefits from broad data availability and automated response. It surfaces grid issues in real time and solves them instantaneously through delegated software, which will dramatically reduce the incidence of outages in the U.S., and optimize regional energy pricing.\n\nUtilities and energy have historically been over-regulated because the financial costs of the power grid are socialized, but the profits generally accrue to a small number of companies and traders. Without data availability to understand and solve issues that consistently arise, arbitrage opportunities in energy markets persist driving energy costs higher and profits into the hands of the motivated few.\n\nDeGENs, in contrast, collaboratively create economic value, and return that value to participants have the potential to usher in an era of collaborative capitalism where inclusion, rather than the exploitation of suppliers drives big profits.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\n",

    "content": "The arrival of ChatGPT changed conventional perceptions about AI and introduced a new paradigm, generative AI. As a matter of fact, it is still the most preferred AI chatbot that helps with different tasks, including writing emails or brainstorming for new projects. However, ChatGPT also has some limitations. Therefore, the ChatGPT vs. Gemini debate has been gaining momentum as Google Gemini is a new and powerful competitor in the generative AI space.\n\nGoogle introduced its generative AI tool, Bard, in March 2023 and rebranded it as Google Gemini in February 2024. Both of them have been responsible for the growing buzz around generative AI. The efforts of OpenAI and Google to encourage the growth of generative AI is commendable. Let us find out more about the differences between ChatGPT and Google Gemini to choose the ideal AI chatbot for desired use cases.\n\n\n\nGoogle is the most recent addition among tech giants investing efforts in refining their generative AI tools. With the experiments on Gemini 1.5 Pro underway, you can notice how Google has sped up its efforts to grow Gemini. The functionalities of ChatGPT and Gemini are similar in many ways.\n\nHowever, the generative AI tools also share similarities in their setbacks, such as the possibility of artificial intelligence hallucinations. On the other hand, both of them have been adopted by consumers and businesses that seek automation of time-consuming tasks. Let us go through an overview of the two generative AI tools before uncovering the differences between them.\n\nChatGPT is the AI chatbot that introduced the world to generative AI in 2022 and became the hottest topic in technology in 2023. Garnering 1 million users in only five days of its launch is definitely a feat that ChatGPT would be remembered for. The Gemini vs. ChatGPT debate would draw your attention towards the use of the generative pre-trained transformer or GPT model.\n\nThe free version of ChatGPT uses the GPT-3.5 model, while the paid version or ChatGPT Plus runs on the GPT-4 model. Some of the notable applications of ChatGPT include creation of content for social media posts, blogs and emails, simulation and training, virtual assistant development, code generation, and research assistance.\n\nWant to develop the skill in ChatGPT to familiarize yourself with the AI language model? Enroll now in ChatGPT Fundamentals Course\n\nGemini is Google’s generative AI model, which was developed by Google DeepMind AI researchers. Google had initially introduced the Bard generative AI tool in March 2023 and rebranded it as Gemini in February 2024. The unique rebranding happened after Google launched the Gemini Advanced powered by Ultra 1.0 LLM.\n\nThe Gemini vs. ChatGPT comparison draws attention to the fact that Gemini has been designed for information retrieval in the form of simple answers. In addition, Google Gemini also has multimodal capabilities that enable a better understanding of audio, computer code, and video alongside text.\n\nThe capabilities of ChatGPT and Google Gemini have reached a level where a beginner would assume that both of them are the same tools. For example, both of them offer free access and have paid subscription services with identical pricing. In addition, both of them are used for the same applications and have similar interfaces.\n\nOn the other hand, the difference between Gemini and ChatGPT has become more evident with the evolution of new variants of Gemini with improved language models. Here is an overview of the important factors that establish clear differences between ChatGPT and Google Gemini.\n\nChatGPT has been developed on the foundations of the GPT language model, primarily the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 versions. You can access the functionalities of these training models in distinct versions, as the GPT-3.5 model powers the free version. ChatGPT Plus users can leverage the capabilities of the GPT-4 model.\n\nAt this point, questions like “Is Gemini AI better than ChatGPT?” draw attention to the models used in Gemini. You can find three different training models underlying the working of Google Gemini in different capacities. Gemini Pro is the suitable pick for different types of generative AI tasks, while Gemini Ultra is an ideal choice for extremely complex tasks. The Gemini Nano model is a trusted tool for enabling access to Gemini functionalities on mobile devices. Furthermore, the Gemini Advanced version that runs on Uthe ltra 1.0 model is more advanced and faster than Gemini Pro.\n\nWant to understand the importance of ethics in AI, ethical frameworks, principles, and challenges? Enroll now in Ethics Of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Course\n\nAnother important aspect of a ChatGPT vs. Gemini debate is the data used to train them. It is a crucial determinant of their accuracy in dealing with generative AI tasks. GPT-3.5 relies on predefined data collection that is limited to January 2022. On the other hand, the GPT-4 model uses data collected before April 2023.\n\nInterestingly, Gemini does not have any boundaries when it comes to training data as it leverages data sourced from the internet. The underlying models of Gemini have been tuned to choose data from sources that align with the relevant topics, such as coding and latest scientific research.\n\nIt is important to note that the ChatGPT and Gemini comparison in terms of training data would turn in favor of Gemini. For example, Gemini Ultra uses a massive dataset that includes 1.6 trillion parameters alongside a training dataset that features 1.56 trillion words.\n\nOn the other side of the debate, GPT-4 has only 1.5 trillion parameters and a training dataset that includes 13 trillion tokens. With more parameters, Gemini has better capabilities to learn and understand language. At the same time, you must also note that Gemini and ChatGPT have been expanding consistently.\n\nGenerative AI users must also be conscious about the privacy of their valuable data. Data privacy is an important facet in a Gemini vs. ChatGPT difference table, as both of them store user data. ChatGPT stores all the queries and prompts that users enter in the generative AI tool, as it allows users to view their previous conversations by using the archive feature.\n\nUsers can delete the responses and conversations. However, ChatGPT may continue using the responses to train its underlying LLM, thereby creating privacy concerns. OpenAI has also disclosed that ChatGPT collects contact details, network activity, and geo-location data.\n\nThe privacy policy of OpenAI implies that it collects personal information provided by users, such as contact information, transaction history, name, and payment card information. OpenAI can also reveal geo-location data to third parties, such as service providers and vendors, as well as law enforcement agencies. On the other hand, OpenAI also states that the user would retain complete ownership rights of input data and output.\n\nGoogle Gemini works differently when it comes to data storage and privacy. It stores the conversations in the Google Account of users for 18 months. However, a Gemini vs. ChatGPT comparison must also emphasize the fact that users can modify the retention period.\n\nOn the other hand, interactions with Gemini can appear in searches, thereby creating privacy concerns. Google also claims that it collects data on usage information, conversations, feedback, and location. On top of it, Google has also stated that it would share information with third parties with the consent of users and strengthen law enforcement.\n\n\n\nThe most important difference between Gemini and ChatGPT is the element of user experience. ChatGPT users can log into the free ChatGPT version by using any email account. In addition, it offers an API that helps integrate OpenAI LLMs into third-party software. It does not have a ‘Save’ option, implying that users can copy and paste ChatGPT responses into other applications.\n\nHowever, you cannot find an ‘Archive’ button that can help in faster retrieval of conversations. As of now, ChatGPT free version works only on text and does not include support for images, links, charts, or videos. On top of that, the free version does not allow users to browse the internet. Interestingly, you can access ChatGPT’s functionalities through different Windows apps.\n\nThe interface of Gemini Pro offers users the choice of liking or disliking a response. Users can also find options for modifying the tone or size of the response and even fact-check responses. Gemini also includes a feature for exporting responses to Gmail or Google Docs. Gemini offers the flexibility for uploading images. Although Google Ultra 1.0 does not have an API, Google has plans to integrate Gemini into Google apps such as Gmail and Docs.\n\nHere is a simple overview of the differences between ChatGPT and Gemini.\n\n\n\nThe differences between OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Gemini showcase that their performance varies by subtle margins. It is difficult to find a clear answer to the question, “Is Gemini AI better than ChatGPT?” as both of them are leading forces in the generative AI landscape.\n\nHowever, the differences between their capabilities would play a major role in determining the ideal way to use them for different tasks. On the other hand, ChatGPT and Google Gemini have been expanding their capabilities continuously, thereby making them more effective.

Enroll Now in Web3 Application Development Course!\n\nThe discussions about web3 gaming future scope must draw inspiration from expert insights for drawing out accurate predictions. Web3 gaming has been attracting a lot of attention in the modern technological landscape for its unique advantages. However, the web3 games you see today are only the beginning. Let us find out what experts have envisioned for the future of web3 games.\n\nIn-game asset ownership is one of the most prominent highlights of web3 gaming. Non-fungible tokens help players prove their ownership of in-game assets in web3 games. The future of web3 gaming might witness in-game asset ownership extending beyond the identity of a digital certificate. It can represent a visible link between real and virtual economies that would foster transformative changes in community engagement and open the doors for new possibilities.\n\nTransactions in the web3 gaming universe are likely to extend to the blockchain rather than being limited to gaming environments. Imagine marketplaces that allow players to transact with their assets on a blockchain network instead of the game itself. It might bring a major transformation in the conventional approaches to transactions in gaming.\n\nThe next crucial trend that would have a major influence on web3 gaming is the rise of blockchain games. Blockchain game development has proved to be a productive venture amidst the challenging scenarios in a crypto bear market. Short-term trends for web3 gaming also indicate that blockchain games would boost the web3 gaming industry.\n\nThe resilience of blockchain-based games in the face of market fluctuations showcase their capability to adapt to diverse scenarios. Developers can now overcome their apprehensions and leverage blockchain technology to create diverse and engaging gameplay experiences. Blockchain games are likely to introduce a fundamental change in the approaches for perception and engagement with games.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nThe growth of web3 gaming in future would depend significantly on industry collaboration. The partnerships between traditional gaming and web3 will be one of the notable future trends of web3 gaming that would drive web3 games forward. Popularity of web3 games has created the foundation for collaborations between traditional gaming studios and web3 startups.\n\nYou can expect a web3 gaming ecosystem in future where collaboration would serve as the driving force. The symbiotic relationship between industry players is likely to open new avenues for innovation in web3 gaming. Strategic collaborations between traditional and web3 gaming would also garner mainstream attention for web3 games.\n\nThe use of NFTs is a prominent highlight in web3 games that would shape the future of web3 games. In addition, you can also expect another formidable trend in the form of AAA games. The combination of these two trends would revolutionize the traditional perception of games and how players interact with them. AAA web3 games with NFT integration can promise gaming experiences that would overcome many of the existing barriers.\n\nWeb3 game developers have been struggling to find the secret key to grow mass adoption. The innovative features of web3 games have been the primary reasons for which they have gained recognition. Experts predict that the answers for “Is Web3 gaming the future?” would revolve primarily around a specific title that would capture the attention of players worldwide. The missing link for web3 adoption might be a title that emerges as a game-changer by transcending the conventional norms.\n\n\n\nThe future of web3 games would also depend on effective resolution of the existing challenges. Industry experts have singled out few formidable threats to the long-term growth of web3 gaming. The difficult onboarding process for web3 games might be a challenge for players who don’t know about cryptocurrencies, smart contracts and NFTs. Web3 games must simplify the onboarding process to expand the possibilities for their adoption on a large scale.\n\nAnother notable challenge evident in the web3 gaming future scope is the lack of engaging gameplay experiences. The play-to-earn or P2E model gives an opportunity to earn income from web3 games albeit with a negative impact on player experiences. Most of the players feel that web3 games are a type of labor without any engaging storylines or appealing graphics.\n\nBuild your fluency in Web3 and develop decentralized solutions with the world’s first Web3 Expert Career Path with quality resources tailored by industry experts Now!\n\nThe review of the trends for the future of web3 gaming shows promising opportunities for the industry. Blockchain games have proved their resilience in challenging market conditions. At the same time, mainstream adoption of blockchain, cryptocurrencies and NFTs also presents favorable prospects for the growth of web3 gaming. Experts believe that the future of web3 games would depend on how the industry capitalizes on existing trends.\n\nOpportunities for collaboration between industry players and exploring new utilities of in-game asset ownership can offer new gaming experiences.

    "content": "Anthony Pompliano, CEO of Professional Capital Management spoke with CoinDesk\u0027s Jennifer Sanasie. The following is a lightly edited transcript of their interview.\n\nJennifer Sanasie: It\u0027s Tuesday, July 30th, and this is Markets Daily, hosted by me, Jen Sanasie. On this show, we navigate the current shaping of the crypto markets, providing insights against the broader financial landscape. Whether you\u0027re actively trading or simply fascinated by the volatility that is the crypto markets, this show is your compass to understanding what\u0027s happened, where we are, and where we\u0027re going. Good morning, everyone. Our guest today needs absolutely no introduction from venture capital, or podcasting. He\u0027s really done it all. Anthony Pompliano, welcome to Markets Daily. Of course, thanks for being here. So as you know, on this show, we really want to dig into the crypto markets. We want to hear from people who have been successful at navigating the crypto markets. So my first question to you is how you\u0027re allocating a portfolio this morning or how you\u0027re thinking about allocating a portfolio if you look at what\u0027s going on in the crypto markets this morning?\n\nAnthony Pompliano: Thanks so much for having me.\n\nYeah, so I don\u0027t really think just about the crypto market. I think kind of more broadly about finance in general and all asset markets. Our portfolio really is, crypto is a dominant percentage, more than 50%. But, we also have large allocations to Osage venture capital. And then we\u0027ve got some real estate. And then increasingly, we\u0027re doing more and more stuff in the public markets as well. On the crypto side, I would say that, you know, the majority of it is in Bitcoin. It\u0027s a position that we\u0027ve held for a long time. We’ve added to it throughout the years and it\u0027s something that we kind of look at as a 20, 30 plus year investment. We don\u0027t really trade at all. We don\u0027t think about possibly selling based on price levels. It really is just kind of buy, hold a great asset forever and then hopefully I give it to my grandkids. The second biggest position in the portfolio is Solana. That\u0027s a relatively new thing. We started putting that position on back around 45, 48 dollars I think last year.and then added to it on the way up pretty consistently. And that\u0027s grown substantially as position size and now second largest. And, then I would say that other things in crypto that we\u0027re really excited about, we sold a company earlier this year called Reflexivity Research to a publicly traded company called DeFi Technologies. DeFi Technologies does ETPs across Europe for kind of the long tail of crypto assets.\n\nAnd, they\u0027ve got a really strong business and seem to be doing pretty well. And so, you know, really just thinking about if crypto is a sector that we want to invest in, how do you get exposure across many different, you know, kind of aspects, both from liquid cryptocurrencies, private companies in terms of venture capital, and then also some of the public companies as well.\n\nJS: You mentioned Sol there, most of the folks who come on this show have their two biggest crypto allocations as Bitcoin and Ether. But you just said you have Sol as your second biggest. I know that you\u0027re bullish on Sol. Talk to me a little bit about your investment thesis when it comes to Solana over Ether.\n\nAP: Yeah, I mean, you know my experience with Solana really was we were LPs in Multicoin\u0027s Fund I and Multicoin Fund I invested in Solana. I think that they did it at less than a dollar, like a couple of pennies. And so there was this explosive move in the bull market of kind 2020 and 2021. Those guys did a fantastic job, I think, of managing that position, capturing a lot of profits there. And then, you know, when they were giving us kind of in-kind distributions,\n\nI was saying to myself and to my partners, I don\u0027t know what this is, right? We literally had spent no time on it, didn\u0027t understand it and didn\u0027t know what to do with the Solana. Do we hold it? Do we sell it? You where do we go? And so obviously in the bear market, it dropped significantly all the way down to I think $8. And then it started to kind of come back. And, one of the things that was interesting to me as I began to look at, why did it not die? It reminded me a lot of Bitcoin, right? Multiple times. Why did that not die? But second was I started to see the beginning\n\nactivity on Solana starting to eat into some of the ether activity or Ethereum activity. And not so much in a game of like Ethereum is not going to be strong or it\u0027s not going to see the token price go up, but more so just the mispriced opportunity, right? If you think that both activities are going to go up, Solana\u0027s activity may just go up at a faster rate. They may actually eat into some of the market share that Ethereum has for certain things like DEX activity or token launches, et cetera.\n\nAnd so, if that was to occur, then you could expect the price of the sol token to go up more than the ether token. And that really was, you know, kind of the analysis. And so, you know, as I\u0027ve shared previously, I sold any of the ether that I personally held kind of around the end of last year, beginning of this year, somewhere, wherever sol was trading at, you know, 70 early $70, $73, something like that. And so far its played out. And you know, I continue to believe that the Solana activity numbers and you know, kind of various macro factors will allow that asset specifically to continue to perform quite attractively. And so we\u0027re just holding\n\nJS: Anthony, what\u0027s the worst investment you\u0027ve ever made?\n\nAP: The biggest investment mistakes are definitely investments I didn\u0027t make, which is kind of like a dumb answer. But if you look at it from a pure capital that was not captured or capital that was lost, there was a number of different companies that early on I saw and just didn\u0027t pull the trigger. I remember working at Facebook and I met with one of the executives at DoorDash. And the company was very small, very early. And, I could have had an opportunity to invest. I didn\u0027t do it. And so when you see those things, you kind of learn over time that the very large asymmetric bets, sometimes it is worth just taking it because the risk reward is so skewed. But those definitely are the ones that kind of cost me the most money are just things that I didn\u0027t do and should have.\n\nJS: Let\u0027s take the DoorDash example for a second. Why didn\u0027t you make that investment? Talk me through your analysis… And what it was about DoorDash that made you skip on that investment?\n\nAP: I\u0027d never made any investments before. I was very much in the operator mindset. I was working at Facebook. I was focused on my job. was frankly, if I was going to do anything with them, I probably would have been like, hey, maybe I should go work there, kind of help on the growth team or something like that. But instead, knowing now what I know, I would have been talking to them from an investor standpoint. I would have said, hey, can I put money into this? And so when you see that, part of it is not just evaluating a specific investment, but also what mindset are you in? How many different early stage startups did I talk to the founders, did I even help the founders over the years before I realized, maybe I should also put money into these companies. And so that was a huge unlock for me personally in my career was putting capital to work, not just kind of being helpful, obviously drives a financial return. And then the other thing that I would say is, understanding kind of portfolio construction. There\u0027s one thing to say…Hey, I\u0027ve got a really high conviction in something like Bitcoin. It\u0027s probably not going to go to zero. And so maybe I could lose, you know, 10, 20%, 30 % of my money, but it\u0027s not like I\u0027m going to lose everything. In venture, you can lose everything. And so really understanding the dynamics of like, well, you have to build a portfolio of these in order to drive an overall return is something that, you know, just took me a while to learn. And then once I understood it, you know, put me in a much better position to allocate capital.\n\nJS: You mentioned just at the top of the show that you plan on holding Bitcoin for 20 or 30 years. We heard from Senator Lamas at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville on the weekend. She put together a proposal for the government to hold Bitcoin for about 20 years to start tackling national debt. I know that you saw those remarks. I know that you\u0027ve made comments on that. But, just curious to hear your thoughts on what you think of Lummis\u0027 plan and holding Bitcoin in the National Reserve to start tackling the $35 trillion worth of debt that this country has.\n\nAP: Yeah, I, you know, I understand what Senator Lummis is saying here. I think it\u0027s a very clever idea. I think, you know, whether the United States holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet as a strategic reserve or as a strategic stockpile, right, actually backing the dollar or not, I think is separate and distinct from kind of the national debt conversation. It\u0027s very hard to see a world where the Bitcoin that the United States would hold would actually, you know, make a significant dent in that. You know, if you look at kind of buying 1 million Bitcoin, 68, $70 billion today. If that goes up significantly, let\u0027s say 20X, it still doesn\u0027t even cover 10 % of the national debt. We actually are growing the debt faster than Bitcoin is growing. And so the debt would continue to expand. But I do think that it\u0027s the right mentality. I think that the courage, frankly, that Senator Lummis has to not only do the work, put together the legislation, you know go present it, stake her own kind of social capital on doing something like that is commendable. And so really now that the idea is whether you think it\u0027s for national debt or for other purposes, the consensus is forming that people across political aisle want the US government to hold Bitcoin. Then you saw that with some of leading presidential candidates, but also now you\u0027re seeing it with senators and congressmen. You\u0027re seeing it kind of in the regular constituency, both Republicans, Democrats, independents. They all are interested in this happening. And so we\u0027re probably not at the point where that consensus is strong enough for it to happen tomorrow. But I do think within the next five years or so, there\u0027s likely to be enough consensus where you\u0027re gonna start to see that occurring at some degree on the national level.\n\nJS: You know, we\u0027ve been talking about the elections for probably every day on this show now. Curious to get your thoughts on what you think a Trump presidency could mean for the crypto industry versus a Harris presidency.\n\nAP: Yeah, I mean, you this is one of those things that there\u0027s a lot of narrative and then there\u0027s kind of the facts and the data. And if you look at, you know, kind of the current administration, they have made more progress for the crypto industry than any other administration before them. Coinbase went public. We got the Bitcoin ETF and we got the Ether ETF. Those three things probably did more for the crypto industry than, you know, all other things combined previously.\n\nIn terms of regulators allowing for certain activity. So although the industry, rightfully so, has seen the current administration as being abrasive, there still was quite a bit of progress that occurred in that abrasive environment. And so, if we get a president, regardless of which president it is, who simply says, hey, we\u0027re going to be friendlier, you would expect there to be an explosion of kind of positive developments. Now, what is interesting to go down that thread is\n\nWell, what are the other things that you really want the regulators to do? Right. Maybe it is approve more ETFs. And so you kind of start going down a coin market cap lists or something of ETFs. Maybe there is something around kind of clear guidance for early stage startups, you know, in terms of token launches or the use of tokens. But the list is probably, you know, five things or less that really the regulators specifically can go and do. Now, if you go and then you add Congress, the Senate, even the president.\n\nAnd, some of the legislation that could be passed. We\u0027ve seen multiple bills around accounting rules and things like that that aren\u0027t necessarily the SEC or the CFTC. That list may expand from five or less to maybe there\u0027s like 25 things that could be done. And so I do think the bulk of a lot of the things people want done are actually in the legislative process, not necessarily from the regulators. Although the call three to five things that people want the regulators to do are really, really important as well.\n\nAnd so really what we\u0027re talking about here is a regime shift or a mentality shift, not just around regulation, but also from the political class in general. And if you go around the world, you\u0027ve seen this happen before. People kind of ignore it, then they fight it, and eventually, the industry wins. And so I think that\u0027s what ultimately is going to happen here in the United States is we\u0027re kind of coming off of the fighting phase, and we\u0027re starting into the winning phase for the industry.\n\nJS: I want to broaden the conversation out and talk about areas outside of the United States. I know you tweeted recently that governments all over the world are probably talking about how Bitcoin might benefit them after the weekend\u0027s remarks. But do think that governments are watching what\u0027s happening here with the election and starting to think about how their policies might impact crypto innovation there and maybe how they can start holding Bitcoin in their reserves?\n\nAP: I definitely think that governments around the world watch the United States, right, for nothing else than to be informed, but possibly even to copy. And you see this with central banks are a great example. The ECB said for a while, we\u0027re not going to raise rates, we\u0027re not going to raise rates. And then they sort of raised the rates after the US did it. And so I think that the United States is the leader on the global stage, especially in the financial markets. People look to us for guidance and leadership. And if you are a president somewhere in the world, and you hear that two of the three leading presidential candidates are talking about a strategic stockpile of Bitcoin for the US, you start asking your team, what is our Bitcoin strategy? What should we do? Should we go buy some before them? If they buy that Bitcoin, the price is going to go up. It\u0027s going to be more expensive for us to buy it later. And so this global game theory between governments ends up playing out. And I think ultimately presidents around the world are saying to themselves, you know, I\u0027m not going to sit back and just be the follower all the time.\n\nMaybe we should actually be a leader on our own. And so, you know, whether that actually occurs or not remains to be seen. But, you one of the funny things to me is if you are a country and you want to create a strategic stockpile, then you should buy the Bitcoin and then tell people you did it. You should not tell them you\u0027re going to buy it and then go buy it because you\u0027re, yeah, you\u0027re likely to affect the price in a negative way.\n\nJS: Makes sense. How likely do you think it is the US has a strategic stockpile of Bitcoin in the near future?\n\nAP: Well, the United States already has 210,000 Bitcoin give or take in its possession. It\u0027s had many more over the years, but their kind of strategy has been to sell that and get cash. And so does the U.S. government hold Bitcoin today? Yes. Is it a strategic stockpile? I don\u0027t think that\u0027s how they view it. But I do think that, I don\u0027t know, over the next 10, 15 years, for sure, the United States will have some Bitcoin on its balance sheet or kind of in a strategic stockpile. I think the question really just becomes, how aggressive are we in that?\n\nAnd then also what is possible, you know, obviously RFK came out and said that the United States should buy 4 million Bitcoin. I don\u0027t think that\u0027s mathematically possible given how illiquid the market is, the trend of that illiquidity, and then also the amount of capital that would be needed in order to buy that Bitcoin over, you know, call it a 15, 20 year period. It just would become, you know, very difficult to see a world where we could spend that much money to do it. And so it\u0027s more likely that, you know, it\u0027s a smaller number but it\u0027s something that I definitely think will occur at some point.\n\nJS: It\u0027s interesting you bring up the fact that you don\u0027t think that\u0027s mathematically possible. And it brings me to this question. Do you think that the politicians are talking about Bitcoin to get the attention of the industry with no...real plan to act to the drastic measures that they are speaking about. Because like you said, in a lot of these cases, it\u0027s not mathematically possible or it doesn\u0027t actually make sense to address the massive growing number of debt in the country.\n\nAP: Yeah, mean, four million is probably not possible. One million probably is, right? So we\u0027re still talking directionally the same thing. It\u0027s just that the magnitude or the size ends up being a little bit different. On top of that, look, politicians are politicians, right? And part of what they are supposed to do is they are supposed to represent the will of the people. One of the things that most people get kind of incorrect is that they\u0027re like, I\u0027m trying to evaluate the politician based on what they believe. Well, actually the politicians supposed to represent what we believe as the people and so you know the negative view of that is they\u0027re pandering they\u0027re basically saying what we, you know, they think we want to hear and then they\u0027re going to get an office do whatever they want. The positive view of it is no, they\u0027re listening to their constituency and their constituency is telling them, I want you to be pro-Bitcoin. So the smart ones are saying I\u0027m pro- Bitcoin. so, you know, regardless, yes, their campaign promises, promises is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence. And so do they have to fulfill the promises? Not necessarily. But I do think that there\u0027s a lot of people who are going to go into the ballot box and they\u0027re going to say, well, I have two candidates that I\u0027m voting for three candidates that I\u0027m going to evaluate the promises of today.\n\nAnd one of them is promising me something I like and the other is promising me something I don\u0027t like regardless of what they\u0027re going to do. I can only evaluate the promises today. And so obviously I\u0027m going to go for the person who\u0027s promising me a positive thing. And so it\u0027s this weird thing where, you know, people always get hung up on like, the politician do what they promised? Well, you you should expect that they probably aren\u0027t going to do a hundred percent of what they promised. And, one of the things I always point to is how many presidents have talked about, you know, releasing some sort of information.\n\nThe JFK assassination files, I think Trump had said, hey, I\u0027m going to release this information, gets in the office, doesn\u0027t do it. And from people I know that were kind of close to the administration, he basically learned new information and then decided against it. And so if that is true and that\u0027s how it played out, well, we don\u0027t know what that information is. And so how do we evaluate? Maybe if we had that information, we\u0027d also agree not to release it. And so it becomes this weird dynamic where constituents and the population want to critique politicians, but we don\u0027t have all the information they have. And so that doesn\u0027t mean we should trust them, right? We should be actually be very kind of skeptical of the promises they make and the things that they say they\u0027re going to do. But I do think that also sometimes we should understand, you know, if we had all of the information, we actually may make the same decisions, which is kind of a little bit weird, given how I think much disdain most people have for kind of political class.\n\nJS: I think those are all great points to make ahead of the election in November now. I know we only have a few minutes left and I really have been waiting to ask you this question because I know you\u0027re a former army sergeant and it\u0027s not uncommon to come across former military who are now founders or operating at high levels in venture capital. And I was curious to get your thoughts on what you think it is about people with military experience that makes them such successful founders and CEOs.\n\nAP: Well, I mean, you the military does a fantastic job, I think, breaking people down and then rebuilding them to be one leaders, but also to thrive in kind of chaotic, uncertain environments. Right. And if you think of the stakes when they\u0027re doing that training. It tends to be life or death. And so when you kind of take that and bring it to something like the business world, you need leadership. You need to be able to understand and be resilient and thrive in that uncertain environment. But the stakes are much lower. And so I think that people have been exposed to some of the extreme stresses of military or kind combat deployments. They end up actually thriving even more in a much more relaxed environment of the business world where the stress is kind of a different type of stress.\n\nAnd so, you know, it I think is a very natural progression because at the end of the day, business is just leading people to accomplish something. And there\u0027s a lot of similarities to what the military is doing in the same way.\n\nJS: When you\u0027re looking at businesses to invest in, do you look at the founders and the experiences they\u0027ve had in the past? Maybe it\u0027s not military experience, but do you look for extraordinary experiences in founders when you\u0027re thinking about investing in their companies?\n\nAP: We\u0027re looking for winners and winning can come in many different forms. But when you\u0027re evaluating a founder, you want to find someone who is going to be able to get the job done. In that, depending on the industry, depending on the stage of the company, depending on a lot of the competitive components to what they\u0027re doing, can be very, very different. Sometimes you need somebody who is very type A personality, somebody who has a long track record of success. But then other times, you actually need somebody who is much more kind of introverted, much younger, much more technical, and frankly, is too naive to understand what they\u0027re trying to do is possible. And so really understanding, what is the task at hand and what is the type of person who\u0027s most likely to be successful here. It\u0027s a case by case scenario.\n\nJS: All right, we got one minute left. got to ask you, I\u0027ve asked you what your worst investment you ever made was. What\u0027s the best?\n\nAP: Probably investing in my family. you know, if, I kept the scorecard of all the financial investments, you know, I probably would, would be pretty proud of that. But frankly, all of the financial investments don\u0027t stack up to, kind of just investing in, you know, human relationships and, making sure that you\u0027re happy every day. And, you know, if you can remember that, all of the investing is just a game that we play on the internet. It\u0027s a lot easier to not get too excited when things are going well and not get too down when things aren\u0027t going well.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "In the massive world of online advertising, blockchain will be a force to reckon with.\n\n",
    "content": "In the massive world of online advertising, blockchain will be a force to reckon with. Unlike with some blockchain products such as cryptocurrency, advertising can employ blockchain in a plethora of unique ways. The applications of this technology in advertising will help ad creatives target audiences better, share data, make users safer and more private, and democratize who controls the data that the industry relies on.\n\nA New Direction for Advertising\n\nOne of the most notable features of blockchain as a finance application is anonymity. While this is a product of blockchain’s origins in bitcoin, for advertising, anonymity is sometimes counter-productive. Blockchain solutions for advertising will instead make use of the robust accountability that the technology provides, wiping the slate clean for all participants.\n\nBlockchains built since the original (bitcoin) have expanded upon the importance of such transparency, and many of the most influential chains will find their killer apps in the advertising world. Companies like Papyrus exemplify this trend, with platforms that make it easy for users to know exactly who is paying to advertise to them, and where their data is coming from. With Papyrus, these users can even decide not to share any of their browsing habits or other usage data, though if they do, advertisers can pay them for it directly.\n\nFrom the user side, this is preferable to the excess of ceaseless, inaccurate ads that bombard us daily. Advertisers might be put off at first, but will quickly realize that the system works in their favor as well.\n\nThis type of schema is a far cry from the current way of doing things, which sees users voluntarily surrender their most personal information with little reward. These are the “terms and conditions” that most people skip over when setting up new applications. With new, blockchain-based platforms like Papyrus and MetaX, all those with a stake in advertising will share resources, see the entire flow of information in the same place, and have an even playing field that allows for more efficient competition.\n\nAnother venture, Bitcomo – a blockchain-driven lead generation platform – is creating a smart contract-based advertising model (pre-sale ICO kicks off on September 18) in which payment is due once results been delivered or after generating a smart contract-triggered sale. Bitcomo offers a solution to the traditional advertising model in which publishers are at the mercy of advertisers who are not always able to pay the entire commission as a protection against leads that were not approved.\n\nSimilarly, advertisers cannot be certain they are getting their money\u0027s worth and are often forced to blacklist publishers who may be conducting fraudulent activities. (See also: Investing in Cryptocurrencies: What to Keep In Mind.)Kanstruktor over at Steemit explains: \"Decentralized network between advertisers and publishers through caching, and logging of clicks and leads, key statistics, personalized nodes in the blockchain operator MetaHash (fork of Ethereum – ERC20). It is a basic principle of protection against fraud and concealment of data on actual transactions from advertisers, or making unrealistic target bots in the traffic of publishers instead of real users.\"Blockchain’s Advertising Chops\n\nFor online advertising, data is precious. It reveals patterns in one’s shopping and search history, comprises social media posts and leaves priceless clues behind. Blockchain distributes this data to the entire network, whereas it was once kept on secure company servers and put up for sale to bidders with a relevant interest.\n\nApart from functionality that gives users more control, and puts the value of their data exclusively in their hands, this decentralized system benefits ad creators as well. They will have access to immense shared pools of relevant data, already vetted by other participants and proven with the chain, making ad targeting much more accurate and much less expensive. Blockchain’s irrefutable, ledger-like system is a perfect tool in the hands of ad companies whose bread and butter are key performance indicators like clicks and likes.\n\nInstead of paying upfront for expensive ad space targeting fishermen, for instance, the same fishing gear company can use a blockchain advertising company to target those who have expressly stated (with their data-sharing preferences) that they are interested in such gear. The game will no longer be based on flighty browsing habits, but on hard data. Moreover, smart contract ad buying solutions make it possible for companies to buy conditional space, which will only show an ad should the target fulfill certain parameters.\n\nBlockchain’s Future in Advertising\n\nOnline advertising companies are just now beginning to develop real use cases for blockchain in their daily activities, and those who get ahead of the curve sooner will benefit greatly. Blockchain is the ultimate democratization tool, and while those who currently protect the status quo are right to be afraid, at some point everyone will realize that an open system creates as many opportunities as it takes away.\n\nThe future is fast in coming, and instead of predicting it, the fast movers are already making it happen.\n\n",

    "content": "After hitting an all-time high of $73,400 in March 2024, the Bitcoin price has since retraced, remaining below its all-time high for the last four months. Nevertheless, expectations remain high that the Bitcoin price will eventually recover and hit a new all-time high, with crypto analyst “Melikatrader94” on TradingView predicting another run to $77,600.\n\nIn the analysis that was shared on the TradingView website, crypto analyst Melikeatrader94 revealed her thesis for why the Bitcoin price could be headed to a new all-time high. The major reason behind the prediction is bullish chart patterns.\n\nThe crypto analyst pointed out that the Bitcoin price had successfully broken out of a descending trend line. This is important because such a break indicates a return of bullish pressure, causing the price to go up. From here, Bitcoin could push toward its current all-time high price.\n\nFurthermore, there have been multiple confirmations on the chart, suggesting that the resulting rally from this descending trend line break could be incredibly strong. The crypto analyst points out that there will be corrections along the way. But ultimately, the direction for the Bitcoin price from here is up.\n\nWith the Bitcoin breakout from the descending trend line, the crypto analyst believes that the price will rise to a new all-time high of $77,604. However, this is not going to be a completely easy path for Bitcoin as major resistance levels lie ahead.\n\nFor starters, the crypto analyst believes that the BTC price risks a downward correction when it eventually gets to $70,000. This makes it the first major level to clear in the road to a new all-time high before encountering another resistance.\n\nIf Bitcoin is able to beat $70,000, then it is expected to reclaim its current all-time high above $73,400. However, it faces major resistance just a short distance away. The analyst’s next resistance level lies at $73,612. Due to this, the analyst believes that both $70,000 and $73,612 could serve as possible re-entry points.\n\nGoing by the crypto analyst’s prediction, the Bitcoin price could see a notable 15% jump in price from its current level. Furthermore, the BTC price hitting a new all-time high would be positive for the crypto market given that the pioneer cryptocurrency is the established market mover and altcoins follow its path.\n\n",

    "content": "After maintaining stable levels around $0.000018 for weeks, Shiba Inu has recently experienced rapid declines with several significant dips. Similarly, Pepe has dropped below the $0.0000012 level, though many market participants believe it still has the potential to surge further.\n\nHowever, the meme coin crypto era is far from over – Shiba Shootout ($SHIBASHOOT) is now gaining attention in the community with its exciting and innovative presale.\n\nThis new play-to-earn game set in the crypto Wild West brings a unique twist to meme coins, combining meme crypto culture with Wild West themes.\n\nLet’s check out the details and see what causes the hype!\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Shiba Shootout Now\u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nShiba Inu has faced solid setbacks recently. Its value plummeted after a hacker infiltrated WazirX’s wallet, causing significant losses. Around 100 million tokens were lost, leading to a 3.3% decline over the past week, with Shiba trading at $0.00001733. Analysts, after reviewing recent trends, predict further potential declines.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Pepe holders are losing confidence and looking for new opportunities. Recently, Pepe’s value surged because of the buzz around the Ethereum ETF, despite the SEC not yet approving the Spot Ether ETF. This optimism drove Pepe, built on Ethereum, to a bullish run. However, Pepe is currently trading at $0.00001217, having dropped 2.9% over the last week, highlighting its inconsistency.\n\nDespite these challenges, opportunities still exist, such as investing in Shiba Shootout ($SHIBASHOOT), which promises explosive gains once it hits the listing.\n\nBelow, we’ll check it out.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Shiba Shootout Now\u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nShiba Shootout ($SHIBASHOOT) brings innovations to the meme coin world by combining crypto culture with Wild West themes. At the heart of this innovative project is Marshal Shiba, a charismatic dog sheriff wearing a cowboy hat and using a blockchain lasso.\n\nLeading the Shiba Sharpshooters, a group of skilled meme creators and crypto enthusiasts, Marshal Shiba maintains order in Shiba Gulch, the project’s active digital hub. Shiba Gulch serves as a dynamic community where members share memes, engage in challenges, and enjoy various themed activities, creating a sense of community and fun like in the Old West.\n\n\n\nThe project’s interactive platform sets it apart, focusing on creativity, strategy, and community involvement. This unique user experience appeals to both crypto enthusiasts and fans of Old West nostalgia. Analysts predict Shiba Shootout could see significant growth when it hits the market, with some speculating about returns of up to 100x if it continues to trend positively.\n\nMarshal Shiba’s mix of modern technology and classic Western adventure makes the project appealing to a wide audience. The Shiba Sharpshooters ensure Shiba Gulch remains a dynamic and active space for all participants, adding to the project’s overall charm.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Shiba Shootout Now\u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nShiba Shootout stands out with its strong themes and engaging features, creating a rewarding experience for its users. The Cactus Staking program, a standout feature, allows token holders to stake their investments from the presale phase, enjoying reward rates exceeding 1200%. Users can visually track their earnings on a digital cactus, making the process fun and interactive.\n\nThe Savings Saddlebags program further motivates long-term holding by allowing users to lock their tokens for a set period and earn bonus $SHIBASHOOT rewards. This feature reduces selling pressure and contributes to the token’s stability and value. Additionally, the Posse Rewards referral program encourages community growth by enabling investors to invite friends and earn extra rewards, creating a sense of teamwork and mutual benefit.\n\n\n\nFor those seeking bigger excitement, the Lucky Lasso Lottery system offers a thrilling chance to win major crypto prizes. Participants buy lottery tickets with Shiba Shootout tokens, and part of the proceeds goes to charity, adding a layer of social responsibility to the project. This combination of fun, rewards, and philanthropy makes the Lucky Lasso Lottery a rewarding feature that attracts a wide audience.\n\nThe various features of Shiba Shootout not only reward investors but also help increase the token’s value. Programs like Cactus Staking and Savings Saddlebags encourage long-term holding, while Posse Rewards and the Lucky Lasso Lottery build a strong, engaged community.\n\nThese innovative features have significantly impacted the live presale, which has already surpassed the $800k mark and is just getting started. Popular crypto analysts and influencers highlight these elements as key drivers of the project’s success, anticipating continued growth and excitement as Shiba Shootout progresses.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Shiba Shootout Now\u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nShiba Inu and Pepe are currently facing challenges, with their values declining over the past few weeks.\n\nHowever, there are many other profitable options available. One of the projects with the most potential to take over is Shiba Shootout ($SHIBASHOOT).\n\nThis trending Wild West token has already secured over $800k in its early phase and appears to be just getting started. Industry experts believe that, because of its exciting story and innovative features, Shibashootout could skyrocket once it hits the market.\n\nIf you want to get in on the action, now is the best time to join the presale while prices are still reasonable!\n\n",

    "summary": "The yield offered by restaking is dwarfed by the likes of yield-generating platform Ethena.\n\nTotal value locked on EigenLayer has dropped by 13% to $15.1 billion in the past 30 days, even though ether is trading at a similar level to June.\n\nOutflows can be attributed to the fickle nature of points farming and the limited returns on restaking protocols.\n\nEther.fi has bucked the trend, experiencing growth in the period.\n\n",
    "content": "Billions of dollars worth of ether (ETH) has been withdrawn from restaking protocols over the past month as the once trendy sector gets its first taste of the fickle nature of crypto investors.\n\nOn June 25, ether (ETH) was trading at $3,300, a shade higher than Thursday\u0027s price of $3,200. During that period, however, the total value locked (TVL) on EigenLayer – a protocol that links restaking protocols – slumped by $2.28 billion to $15.1 billion. Restaking protocols like Renzo and Kelp have lost 45% and 22% of their TVL, respectively, data from DefiLlama shows.\n\nRead more: Jito Releases Open-Source Restaking Service for Solana\n\nA portion of the outflows can be attributed to depositors looking to harvest points that will eventually be converted to airdrops subsequently moving on to another project to maximize returns.\n\nFor others, the yield is too low when compared with specific yield-generation protocols like Ethena. Renzo offers an annual yield of 3.43%; Ethena offers more than 10%.\n\nRestaking is a strategy that investors use to secure an additional yield on ETH that is already staked on the main Ethereum blockchain. Protocols like Ethena generate a yield by harvesting funding rates, which can be more volatile.\n\nOne restaking project that has managed to buck the trend is ether.fi, which has seen a $100 million increase in TVL.\n\n",

    "content": "International Data Corp.has released a new update to its Worldwide Semiannual Blockchain Spending Guide where it predicts that annual global spending on blockchain solutions will reach $11.7 billion by 2022. It represents a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 73.2%.\n\nWith current year global blockchain spending expected to stay at around $1.5 billion, the target of $11.7 billion over the next four years indicates a robust pace of growth for blockchain adoption at the global level across various industries. (See also: Can Blockchain Become the Global Standard?)Finance Leads in Blockchain Adoption\n\nThe financial sector will lead blockchain spending during 2018, said the report. Its $552 million expenditure during 2018 will be largely driven by the banking industry.\n\nThe next biggest blockchain spender during 2018 comes from distribution and services sector, which will contribute $379 million, aided by investments from the retail and professional services industries. The manufacturing and resources sector, which is expected to invest $334 million in 2018, takes the next spot, which will see increased blockchain adoption from the discrete and process manufacturing industries. The highest growth rate is forecasted to be within the process manufacturing (78.8% CAGR), professional services (77.7% CAGR) and banking (74.7% CAGR).\n\nThe report further predicts that use cases for cross-border payments \u0026 settlements are expected to see the largest blockchain spending in 2018 ($193 million). It will be followed by lot/lineage provenance ($160 million), and trade finance \u0026 post-trade/transaction settlements ($148 million). The study predicts that these three use cases will continue to remain the largest in terms of overall spending in 2022.\n\nGlobal Blockchain Adoption\n\nGeographically, the United States is expected to lead the pack with more than 36% of global spending throughout the forecast period. It will be followed by the Western Europe, China, Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan and China) and the Middle East and Africa.\n\nIn terms of the highest growth rate, Japan and Canada will lead with CAGRs of 108.7% and 86.7%, respectively.\n\n\"Enthusiasm for blockchain continues to be universally shared across regions as businesses and organizations alike continue to explore the technology’s potential business application,\" said Stacey Soohoo, research manager with IDC\u0027s Customer Insights \u0026 Analysis team. \"Regulatory concerns and industry standards continue to hinder widespread adoption as governments around the globe work with enterprises to formulate policies and governance. As such, cross-business collaboration and blockchain interoperability are emerging as key aspects in the growth of the distributed ledger technology.\" (See also: What\u0027s Stopping Blockchain from Mainstream Adoption?: Video.)",

BTC lost as much as 5%, before slightly recovering, in the past 24 hours as the U.S. Marshals Service shifted $2 billion worth of BTC to two new wallets. Tracking service Arkham estimated that at least one of the wallets was likely to be a custodial service. Bitcoin was trading around $66,550 at the time of writing, a drop of 4.3% from 24 hours ago.

The equivalent bitcoin funds, which debuted in January, raked in $1 billion in net inflows during the first four days, even as they too suffered sizable outflows from a previously existing Grayscale fund. Overall, the spot ETH ETFs lost $340 million in net outflows with more than $1.5 billion exiting from the Grayscale Trust, according to Farside Investors.

Trump promised to maintain a strategic bitcoin reserve and never sell the government’s seized bitcoin (BTC) at BTC 2024 in Nashville on Saturday. “His overtures to the industry to install crypto-friendly regulators may have the effect of near-term BTC price being tied to the outcome of the U.S. presidential election,” analysts Jonathan Petersen and Joe Dickstein wrote. Jefferies notes that Trump pledged to pick crypto-friendly regulators, to create a crypto industry presidential advisory council, and to make the country the “crypto capital of the planet.”\n\n",

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump is set to deliver a keynote address at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, this weekend, amid growing speculation that Trump may announce Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset for the United States. This move could have a significant impact on the entire cryptocurrency industry.\n\nAccording to a CNBC report, Trump has raised over $4 million in campaign contributions from a variety of digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Circle’s USDC stablecoin, and various memecoins, ahead of his highly anticipated appearance at the conference.\n\nPer the report, the contributions were made through the “Trump 47” joint fundraising committee, which raised over $118 million between April 1 and June 30.\n\nThe report also indicates that at least 19 donors contributed more than $2.15 million in Bitcoin to the committee, with contributions from 12 states, including some considered “key battleground regions.”\n\nCNBC found that donors’ occupations ranged from housewives to US military officers, missionaries, painters, sales representatives, and State Department security technicians.\n\nCrypto figures like the Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron, founders of the US-based crypto exchange Gemini, each contributed over $1 million in Bitcoin. At the same time, Mike Belshe, the CEO of digital asset security company BitGo, donated $50,000 in the cryptocurrency.\n\nThese contributions reflect the growing support for Trump within the crypto industry, which represents a significant shift from his previous stance during his time in the White House.\n\nTrump’s pivot towards a pro-crypto stance has been gradual. Still, it has gained momentum in recent months with moves such as launching his non-fungible token (NFT) collection on the Solana blockchain in April, which has since made increasingly bullish comments on cryptocurrency.\n\nFurthermore, the former president’s appearance at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, where he will also host a campaign fundraiser, is viewed as a strategic move to solidify his position as the pro-crypto candidate for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe report noted that the event’s tickets range from $60,000 per person for a photo with Trump to $844,600 per person for a seat at a roundtable with the former president.\n\nThe former president’s support for self-custody of cryptocurrencies, his vow to defend the rights of those who choose to do so, and his pledge to keep Senator Elizabeth Warren and “her goons” away from Bitcoin holders have further endeared him to the crypto community.\n\nTrump’s decision to name Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate has also been viewed as a win for the crypto sector. Vance has advocated for looser regulation of cryptocurrencies and disclosed his holdings of Bitcoin.\n\nAt the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is struggling to find support at the $65,130 level following a 2% price drop in the early hours of Thursday’s trading session.\n\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com\n\n",

    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "How to find smart contract bugs like the original Polygon MRC20 implementation, what to do when you find them, and what happens next.\n\n",
    "content": "Special thanks to Adrian Hetman, Alejandro Munoz-McDonald, Ivan Benavides, and Leon Spacewalker.\n\nHunting for smart contract bugs can be a ludicrously well-paying job, and it’s also an integral part of protecting the ecosystem from hacks. I recently had the pleasure of interviewing a developer who found a $7 billion dollar bug—and was paid $2.2M for reporting it.\n\nIn this blog, we’re going to go through the bug that this developer found and how it had the potential to compromise $7b in value before offering some strategies and tools that will help you find bugs.\n\nLet’s dive in.\n\nOn May 31, 2020, the Matic blockchain went live (Matic would later be rebranded as Polygon). Polygon is an EVM-compatible blockchain known for it’s low gas fees and short block time. The chain has recently begun exploring zk-rollup technology.\n\nIf you take a look at block 0 of Polygon, the absolute first block of the blockchain, also known as its “genesis” block, you’ll see 10 transactions. One of these transactions created a contract called MRC20.\n\nWhat is this contract?When we send a native blockchain token we have to spend gas to do so. So the Polygon team deployed a contract that allows you to sign a transaction to send someone ETH, with someone else able to pay the gas fee for this transaction. Known as a “meta transaction,” this capability was popularized with the introduction of EIP-712.\n\nYou can see that this contract was given almost 10 billion MATIC tokens in order to help facilitate these gasless transactions. However, this clever contract contained a vulnerability that could have potentially been exploited to drain the entire balance!On December 3rd, 2021 the hero of the story, pseudo-anon developer Leon Spacewalker, submitted a report to the Immunefi bug bounty program laying out the details of this exact function. A second hero, who we will just call Whitehat2, also reported the vulnerability a day later.\n\nAround 800,000 MATIC tokens were stolen before the chain was finally forked, rolled back, and fixed December 5th, 2021.\n\nThis leaves us with some more questions: What was the vulnerability? How did it stay undiscovered for so long? How was it found?Below is the function that facilitates these gasless transactions.\n\nAt first glance, it seems harmless: It takes the signature of the user, how many tokens and who they want to send them to, and any further data, along with an expiration date for the transaction.\n\nIt runs some requires, gets the data hash in order to send the meta transaction, makes sure the data hash hasn’t been used, and does this ecrecovery function.\n\nThis function is essentially a wrapper for the Solidity ecrecover function.\n\nThis function is how we can verify where signed transactions are coming from. You’ll notice, even in the Solidity documentation, it says it will “return zero on error”. The ecrecovery function copied this, and if it had an issue, it would return 0. Which, as many developers know, can be scary. If it returns zero on error, that means that we should check to make sure that the returned address isn’t zero, right?Here’s the actual code:Here’s what should probably be there:So we don’t perform a check on the address to make sure it didn’t result in an error. Not a problem. The last line of code in our transferWithSig function does the actual transfer, surely we will perform some sort of check there, right?The _transferFrom function just called our _transfer function, shown above. You’ll notice it doesn’t check to make sure the from address has enough money.\n\nThis means that someone could send an invalid signature, which would result in a zero address returned from ecrecovery, but the MRC20 contract would still send the to address an amount of money. This is how that 9,999,993,000 MATIC could be drained, since the MRC20 contract sends the money directly from itself!A check to make sure that the from address has enough money for this signed transaction would have prevented this issue.\n\nWhat’s odd to me is that, after the vulnerability laying dormant for almost a year and a half, it was discovered by Leon, another white hat, and a hacker within the span of a few days.\n\nSeems fishy. But the Immunefi team told me this can often happen. Some exploits can become popular based on an article, write-up, or challenge and people then start looking for that vulnerability, resulting in several people finding it at the same time.\n\nBut more likely is that it turns out that polygon verified the contract on Polygonscan around this time – so that was when people really started to look at it.\n\nMaybe there is more to the story, but maybe not.\n\nIn any case, let’s use this bug as a teachable moment and look at some of the skills Leon and other bug hunters use to find bugs, helping protect the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nNow, we are going to learn the skills Leon and other bug hunters use to find these vulnerabilities and claim bug bounties. This list of tips assumes you already know the basics of smart contracts, so yes, learning Solidity is a prerequisite.\n\nUse these superpowers for ethical hacking, and please remember to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you find.\n\nA lot of the work of finding vulnerabilities comes from looking at the code and running tools like slither. For this $2.2M payout, Leon said he was able to find the bug by looking line-by-line at the smart contract code, so remember, finding vulnerabilities is often a huge manual lift!In addition to the practical tips below, Leon’s biggest takeaway was for smart contract bug hunters to “find your edge,” but what does he mean by that? Typically, this means finding that thing that sets you apart from other hackers. We as a community need to cover every corner of the smart contract space, so find a section that you are specifically good at and excel.\n\nHere are the seven strategies and tips to help find your edge, to make you a successful smart contract bug hunter.\n\nThe first way you can find bugs is to know every inch of how a protocol works. This is one of the first skills every smart contract bug hunter needs to be learn: the ability to understand a protocol end to end.\n\nGo through docs, try to reimplement a protocol yourself, and view transactions through that protocol on a block explorer.\n\nLeon said this strategy works for other hunters but not him. He focuses on the next three, but it’s important for every bug hunter to be able to do this.\n\nAn easier approach to hunting for bugs is to find a bug that not a lot of people know about and try to see which protocols have implemented it.\n\nThis strategy takes a lot of research, as there are a lot of people working on exposing bugs to the general public.\n\nYou first need to understand all the basic smart contract exploits, and then their advanced versions. You need to be aware of best practices and see if there are protocols that have not followed them.\n\nOnce you find a smart contract bug you think a lot of projects might not have protected against, start searching for that bug. Get really familiar with this new bug and how to find it. And be sure to write a blog or some kind of post to help other smart contract developers who run into this bug protect themselves.\n\nProjects that want bug hunters to look at their smart contracts need to sign up for bug bounty programs like Immunefi. And you’ll want to be one of the first developers to find the new bounties. If you start looking at a contract before other hunters, you’ll have more time to find a bug than other hunters.\n\nThere are a few ways to be fast—one of the ways Leon was able to find the smart contract vulnerability before others was by having notifications on for the Immunifi updates Discord channel. He received a notification anytime a new project came in, or a project was updated. Tools like this can help you get to digging into code before anyone else does.\n\nAnother way Leon was able to get an edge, was traversing community forums, and finding out they were thinking about submitting a bug. He’d then start looking at the smart contracts even before the bounty was approved. This gave him way more time to look at a contract than other developers, since they would wait for a bug bounty to be submitted.\n\nBug hunters use tools like the VSCode Solidity visual developer extension, Hardhat, Foundry, Brownie, Dune, Etherscan, plus a host of others.\n\nA typical bug hunting strategy might be loading up VSCode, adding the code to VSCode with the Solidity visual extension, and going line by line looking for common bugs or bad best practices.\n\nAfter finding a weakness, setting up a testing environment to run tests on the contract is a good next step. You can often reuse a lot of the tests the developers of the protocol originally used.\n\nNot much else to say here. Audit firms make mistakes. Many of the projects Leon found vulnerabilities for had been audited by top firms.\n\nUsing the skills we talked about in this blog can be the difference for you to find these issues!One of the biggest advantages in finding your edge is specializing in a specific niche. If you understand one area incredibly well, you’ll have the advantage of knowing how all the functions interact with each other. If you’re a phenomenal smart contract vulnerability expert but don’t know anything about DeFi, it’ll be hard to find vulnerabilities in DeFi contracts. For example, a lot of developers understand code, but don’t understand financial primitives.\n\nYou could get incredibly good at understanding decentralized exchanges, borrowing protocols, or maybe just NFTs!If you can become a master of security and a master of a certain vertical within Web3, you’ll be well-positioned to have a massive leg up on everyone else looking for bugs.\n\nI hope this piece is useful to you in your smart contract bug-hunting journey. If you want to learn more about security when writing your smart contracts, be sure to check out Top Ten DeFi Security Best Practices.\n\nAnd, as always, I hope to see you out there building and keeping the ecosystem a little safer.\n\nMRC20 contract.\n\nImmunefi writeup.\n\nChange to Polygon contracts.\n\nPrevious Polygon contracts.\n\nEcrecovery challenge.\n\nThe opinions expressed within this post are solely the author’s and do not reflect the opinions and beliefs of the Chainlink Foundation or Chainlink Labs.\n\n",

    "summary": "Why do blockchains and crypto matter? This deep dive explores how blockchain-based technologies are offering new infrastructure for establishing trust across social and economic processes.\n\n",
    "content": "This is Part 1 of a two-part series on the future of trust. Read Part 2, Cryptographic Truth: The Future of Trust-Minimized Computing and Record-Keeping, for a walkthrough of the cryptographic fundamentals that underpin blockchain technology and how Chainlink oracles extend the reach of cryptographic guarantees to the off-chain world.\n\nThe word “trust” is a heavily debated term in the blockchain industry, where engineers often refer to zero-trust interaction systems, trustless transactions, and other trust-minimized technologies. Though personal interpretations of its meaning in blockchain both vary and overlap, trust will always be at the center of understanding what crypto is really about.\n\nDeriving from the Old Norse word traust, meaning “confidence” and also “shelter,” trust has historically referred to the amount of belief one has that people and processes will stay true to their commitments. Trust is foundational to well-functioning societies: high-trust societies generally have increased economic activity and greater social harmony thanks to reduced counterparty risk and fairer dispute resolution.\n\nUnfortunately, trust in the institutions responsible for facilitating core social and economic activities is beginning to break down. For instance, Gallup polls indicate that the U.S. population’s confidence in many of the country’s major institutions has been declining over the past 45 years. While the scope of distrust varies across industries and nations, it’s clear from the current negative sentiment toward established systems that people are searching for more equitable solutions.\n\nBlockchains, cryptocurrency, smart contracts, and oracles have emerged as new technologies for coordinating social and economic activities in a more secure, transparent, and accessible manner. Most importantly, these technologies are revealing the power of cryptographic guarantees—what we often call cryptographic truth—in restoring users’ trust in everyday interactions.\n\nNote: We use the word “app” in a broad sense to refer to any interface for interacting with a company, government, or other users on the same platform, whether it be an application you download on your phone or a website. Additionally, when explaining blockchains, we focus on permissionless blockchains (e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin) given their widespread adoption as opposed to permissioned blockchains.\n\nThe breakdown of trust in traditional institutions and processes is apparent in many aspects of modern societies. Listed below are four problems causing distrust, which directly impact quality of life and economic prosperity.\n\nOne outcome of the way the Internet was originally architected is that applications (apps) are mostly centralized. A centralized entity typically owns an app’s intellectual property (IP), controls its backend computing, makes key decisions on its future development, and profits from any data and revenue generated. This centralization creates an unequal relationship between users and apps that can easily be abused and fuel distrust.\n\nFor example, apps can often unilaterally censor the actions of users. Though such actions may be justified as clear violations of terms of service agreements such as the removal of illicit activities, there are many instances where censorship is based on subjective interpretations of vague policies. This puts into question the platform’s credible neutrality—no discrimination for or against any specific people—particularly in situations when the platform’s own financial interests are at stake, external political or social pressure is applied, or users’ personal opinions don’t directly align with the platform’s own. Such forces have resulted in polarizing debates as to whether social media, financial services, content streaming, and various other platforms are justified in censoring or not censoring certain content.\n\nCentralization also leads to power structures where small groups of people largely control how platform revenue is distributed and the direction of development while users are left without much say. Though it’s true that owners generally start and manage apps and are to an extent responsible for their success, it’s also true that users often provide immense value to apps as content creators. For instance, users give social media platforms value through the material they generate, which is monetized directly by app developers via advertising. This undoubtedly makes users question whether or not they are getting fair compensation and representation.\n\nUsers are also becoming more concerned about having to trust apps with their sensitive data. Since users often have to create accounts to interact with apps, the apps are responsible for storing users’ personal information. This centralized storage model opens up a single point of attack for hackers that has resulted in numerous data breaches, as was the case with Equifax, for example. It’s also why apps are able to monetize users’ data without sharing revenue with users. As many have suggested, “if it’s free, then you’re the product” is the basis for most Web2 economic models.\n\nA further reason for distrust is the fact that participants in a social or economic relationship don’t always operate with reference to the same source of truth. For instance, there are many business relationships where all participants maintain their own set of records. Not only can an honest mistake from a single participant lead to a lengthy reconciliation process, but it’s possible for parties to intentionally falsify their records in an attempt to delay the agreement, escape their obligations, or present a false sense of success to their counterparties.\n\nLook no further than the Wirecard scandal, which saw many financial services companies take losses when the German company Wirecard was found to be engaging in fraudulent accounting practices to cover up €1.9 billion in missing funds from its balance sheet. Similarly, the 2007-2008 financial crisis severely impacted the global financial industry, largely because of a poor shared understanding regarding its systemic overexposure to toxic mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and MBS-linked derivatives.\n\nUnderpinning this dynamic is the fact that users don’t always understand the legal relationship they have with an institution. Though the misunderstanding could be interpreted as the fault of users for not reading terms of service agreements, it’s fair to ask whether users should be expected to take time to read and understand long contracts with dense legal jargon that’s purposely vague in order to enable a range of interpretations. When things are going well, misunderstandings may never manifest. However, when unexpected events occur, users often learn that their relationship with an institution is not quite what they thought. Unclear legal relationships are why many traders were blindsided when they learned Robinhood could halt purchases of the GME stock during a period of high trade volume, or why Greek citizens were shocked in 2015 when their banks informed them that they were only allowed to withdraw €60 a day from ATMs.\n\nThe same misunderstanding is often true regarding the relationship users think they have with social media apps, particularly with regard to how their data is collected and shared and how the app’s algorithm determines what they see in their news feeds. Algorithms in particular have fueled distrust because of their opaque nature, with users unable to understand why some material takes preference while other material is not shown at all. This lack of clarity naturally leads to users suggesting political bias or undisclosed influences around the news that’s deemed real and credible and the news that isn’t, further causing a breakdown of trust.\n\nDisputes are inevitable in certain circumstances, so when they arise it’s critical to resolve them in a manner that’s generally seen as fair. The challenge, however, is that larger institutions often have asymmetrical advantages in dispute resolution processes. This is particularly worrisome in contracts between established institutions and retail users, where the institution knows they have more leeway to renege on their stated commitments given that the user doesn’t have the time, capital, or influence to mount a successful lawsuit. In fact, in some developing countries, the legal system is so unreliable in the face of powerful influences and bribery that certain economic relationships are simply not practical.\n\nMistrust in dispute resolution processes is also subject to a dynamic where an institution becomes so powerful and integrated within a society that it becomes “too big to fail”—a phrase used to describe institutions that governments will bail out after they make poor decisions because their failure presents too much systemic risk. The term was originally derived from the public bailout of large banking and financial services companies that went bankrupt due to overexposure to toxic MBS assets during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. It could be argued that a similar dynamic can be seen today in a seeming lack of accountability from governments and central banks, as high inflation and increasing economic inequality takes hold despite their stated goals of controlling inflation and promoting economic stability.\n\nThrough the addition of trusted third parties and manual verification techniques, the risks of low-trust social and economic relationships can be somewhat offset. However, these processes involve increased costs, longer wait times, and additional trust assumptions. One industry subject to such inefficiencies is international remittances, where a $200 dollar transaction in 2020 incurred on average a 6.5% fee and sometimes took more than 24 hours to settle. Technically, remittances could be near-instant given advancements in digital technology, but not all banks trust each other. Thus, payments have to be routed through several correspondent banks to get to their final destination, incurring fees and extending the settlement time along the way.\n\nInstead of counterparties having to trust each other or a third party to follow through on their stated commitments, what if the infrastructure facilitating their interaction could guarantee fair outcomes? And what if that infrastructure had no central administrator or owner?In order to meet these goals, this infrastructure would have to embody two key design principles: minimally extractive coordination and trust-minimized execution.\n\nBlockchains combine these two properties, serving as minimally extractive coordinators that execute code in a trust-minimized manner. Blockchains provide such properties because they do not have central administrators, but are decentralized computer networks that are financially incentivized to maintain an accurate ledger of who owns specific data and assets on the network. Every time someone creates a new asset, transfers an existing asset to another user, or stores data on the blockchain, a decentralized network of nodes must form a consensus around the validity of each interaction before it’s approved. For instance, if a user wants to send money from one account to another, the blockchain will verify that the user has enough money to fund the transaction before executing it.\n\nDecentralized consensus and cryptography are combined in blockchains to form the basis for cryptographic truth—validation of new transactions based on the verification of historical information already stored in the blockchain ledger and deemed true. In this sense, blockchains are deterministic, since approving new transactions doesn’t require new or external information.\n\nFor a deeper understanding of blockchains, refer to these articles: What is Blockchain Technology? and Blockchains and Oracles: Similarities, Differences, and Synergies.\n\nWhile many recognize blockchains for supporting cryptocurrency-based payment systems, blockchains enable much greater utility through their support for smart contracts. Smart contracts are “if x, then y” programs that run on blockchains in a tamper-proof manner. Developers use one or more smart contracts to create decentralized applications (dApps), with the smart contracts essentially representing the terms and conditions that users must abide by when interacting with the dApp. For a deep dive on smart contracts, check out this article: What Is a Smart Contract?Oracles are critical to creating advanced dApps. Because of the way blockchains are secured, they are inherently disconnected from the outside world—akin to a computer without the Internet. Oracles are supporting infrastructure for blockchains that allow them to interact with external data and systems. In doing so, oracles enable smart contracts to use external data to trigger their execution (e.g. sports match results to settle a wager), send data to external systems for settlement (e.g. payment messages to execute a bank payment), interoperate with smart contracts on other blockchains, and perform computations not possible or practical to do on a blockchain. In this regard, oracles enable hybrid smart contracts—combining on-chain code with off-chain code to form a single application.\n\nChainlink pioneered decentralized oracle networks (DONs) in order to bring trust-minimized properties to oracle services and enable competitive marketplaces that mitigate rent-seeking extraction from oracle providers. The result has been an explosion in new smart contract use cases enabled by Chainlink DONs, such as in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Play-to-Earn gaming (P2E), decentralized insurance, and more.\n\nTo learn more about oracles and Chainlink, refer to these articles: What is a Blockchain Oracle? and What is Chainlink? A Beginners Guide.\n\nThe combination of blockchains and oracles provides an end-to-end trust network for coordinating economic and social activities. Blockchains act as tamper-proof backends for codifying, tracking, and enforcing digital contracts while oracles enable smart contracts to accurately verify real-world events, seamlessly interact with legacy systems, and securely interoperate across blockchains. This model shifts applications and digital contracts from probabilistic and human-mediated to deterministic and verified through decentralized consensus.\n\nBy applying blockchain and oracle-powered trust networks to the original problems outlined above, it becomes possible to build a world based on truth, where processes and people stick to their agreements and records are highly reliable.\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of blockchain technology is the decentralization of the apps/institutions responsible for facilitating social or economic activity. Blockchain technology can create credibly neutral platforms where the ability for platforms to arbitrarily censor users because of financial, political, or social pressures is largely removed. Once the terms and conditions are coded into smart contracts and stored on the blockchain, the relationship between the users and dApps is transparent to all and cannot be overridden by either party or a central administrator.\n\nDecentralized system design also removes intermediaries as custodians. Instead, the blockchain is akin to a non-custodial facilitator, where all the data produced by dApps is publicly viewable and immutable, and the users have direct control of their data/assets via private keys that only they possess. For instance, anyone can view the entire transaction history of the Bitcoin ledger and anyone can custody and send their Bitcoin to other users on the network without a bank.\n\nAdditionally, privacy-preserving oracle solutions are emerging, such as Chainlink’s DECO, which is being built to allow users to prove sensitive information to dApps without revealing it publicly. For example, a user could prove they live in a certain jurisdiction or that their bank balance is above a certain amount without revealing their address or exact balance to the dApp—ultimately removing the responsibility from dApps to store credentials while still making use of them.\n\nBlockchains and the dApps they support are also democratizing access to their cash flows. The Ethereum blockchain, for example, is moving to a proof-of-stake consensus model where anyone in the world can stake (i.e. lock up in a non-custodial manner) its native ETH cryptocurrency in a specific smart contract in order to become a validator on the network. In becoming a validator, the user can earn a portion of the value generated by the Ethereum blockchain as a reward for validating user transactions.\n\nSimilar dynamics exist in DeFi applications like Curve, a decentralized exchange designed for low-slippage trades. Within Curve, users can choose to lock the native CRV token in a staking smart contract for up to four years, which provides them with governance rights over the dApp and a proportional percentage of 50% of all trading fee revenue generated by the dApp.\n\nBlockchains and dApps are generally open-source technologies where all users have a shared understanding of the code powering the dApp and the data generated from its operations. Essentially, the blockchain is a single, public repository of records that are made equally available to all participants, removing reconciliation disputes and making transparent any systemic risk. Transactions are also verified through a decentralized consensus mechanism as opposed to the opinion of a single user or administrator, meaning the relationship between users and dApps will follow the codified terms.\n\nWhen extended to verifying external connections, oracles often use a decentralized network of nodes and numerous data sources to prevent any single point of failure in verification and execution. For example, Chainlink Price Feeds are DONs that supply real-time asset prices on blockchains to support Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a collection of dApps that provide financial services to users such as lending, derivatives, stablecoins, and more.\n\nOther oracle solutions for generating shared truth include the Ledger of Record proposed by Balaji Srinivasan, former Coinbase CTO and A16Z General Partner. The Ledger of Record is a concept that uses oracles to cryptographically sign data on blockchains to prove its origin, helping establish a verifiable provenance of information. Not only would it help prevent fake news, deep fakes, and hidden news retractions, but it can be the basis for reputation systems that track the historical credibility of data sources and analysts.\n\nBecause blockchains validate transactions on their networks through decentralized consensus, the asymmetrical advantages held by larger counterparties during disputes are generally removed. There is no blockchain administrator to bail dApps out or hit redo after a mistake is made. Instead, blockchains replace human administrators with decentralized networks secured by cryptography and financial incentives to make it extremely difficult to tamper with the consensus mechanism or alter previously stored data.\n\nWhile blockchains and dApps can be built in a manner that enables changes, they generally require social consensus amongst many independent users as opposed to the unilateral decision-making seen in centralized Apps. This is why many dApps are governed through decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), where users vote on changes. In fact, many dApps have their own native token, which is used by their DAOs to decide on proposals via token-weighted votes.\n\nA highly tamper-proof and globally accessible blockchain platform for enforcing digital contracts vastly reduces counterparty risk. Many blockchains and dApps even take it a step further by introducing automatically enforced punishments for bad behavior from participants. For instance, proof-of-stake blockchains can punish validators that act maliciously by confiscating some of their staked tokens as a form of punishment. dApps can also hold users’ capital in escrow and distribute it only after verifying certain events, making it near impossible for the losing side to forgo payment.\n\nDecentralized oracle networks offer similar assurances by generating definitive truth—where each dApp defines exactly how they want to derive truth from the external world and what falls outside of those bounds. In this sense, oracles are more flexible in verifying external events for smart contracts, as some users may trust different data sources while others may want to pay for more decentralization of the oracle network. No matter how the users design the oracle mechanism, they must all agree that it’s sufficient to service their needs. The agreement between the users and oracles can then be made into a Service Level Agreement (SLA) smart contract to avoid tampering and automatically enforce rewards/penalties upon completion.\n\nOne example of an oracle service that provides definitive truth is Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF). Chainlink VRF uses oracle technology to generate random numbers and cryptographic proofs off-chain. It then publishes them on-chain, where the blockchain uses the cryptographic proof to verify that the random number was not tampered with by the oracles. NFT and gaming applications use the randomness provided by Chainlink VRF to perform various on-chain functions, such as picking winners of special NFT drops and determining the content of loot boxes. Importantly, users are able to independently verify that the process is fair and unbiased, with even the game developers/NFT creators not able to influence the randomized outcome.\n\nNot only do blockchains provide higher security, reliability, and accuracy guarantees for their computations, but they operate in a peer-to-peer manner. By removing intermediaries, rent-seeking and settlement times can be reduced. This is most evident in Ethereum layer-2 scalability solutions—networks built on top of Ethereum that are optimized for lower costs and higher throughput while still deriving their security from the baselayer Ethereum blockchain. With layer-2 solutions, users can make peer-to-peer payments of any amount to anyone in the world in a matter of minutes and for less than a standard international wire fee.\n\nThis peer-to-peer quality is also evident in new parametric insurance dApps such as those created by Arbol and Etherisc, which enable anyone to purchase weather and flight insurance, with the only requirement being an Internet connection. The smart contract settles the policy once an oracle network confirms the outcome of the specific insurable event, e.g. crop insurance settled by the amount of seasonal rainfall in a particular region or flight insurance determined by whether or not flights are canceled. Once the oracle report is delivered, the smart contract can instantly release compensation from escrow without needing any human approvals.\n\nIf the innovation timeline of the Internet is any indicator, society has only just scratched the surface of what’s possible using blockchain and oracle technology. The possibilities are truly endless, and have the potential to re-establish trust in society’s most foundational social and economic processes.\n\nIf blockchain technology interests you and you want to begin working in the industry, check out our walkthrough How to Become a Smart Contract Developer to learn how to start building and explore careers at industry-leading organizations like Chainlink Labs, where there are a wide range of open technical and non-technical roles.\n\nIf you want to familiarize yourself more with blockchain and oracle technologies, we encourage you to read through the growing list of educational materials on our blog.

    "summary": "Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto has identified a bullish pattern that can send the XRP price to new highs soon.\n\n",
    "content": "Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto has identified a bullish pattern that can send the XRP price to new highs. This comes amid the growing increase in the investors’ bullish sentiment towards the XRP token.\n\nMikybull Crypto stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that XRP has formed a bull pennant continuation pattern on the daily chart. The analyst added that the “breakout will be massive,” with XRP set to rise above $1 based on the chart he shared. Mikybull Crypto seemed really confident that XRP would rise to such heights, as he claimed that this bullish pattern “rarely fails.”\n\nA bull pennant is a technical indicator that signals the continuation of an uptrend after a period of consolidation. Mikybull Crypto had previously mentioned that XRP was going to have a cool-off period after hitting the first short-term target of $0.58. Indeed, XRP is currently experiencing a consolidation period, having hovered around the $0.60 range for the past few weeks.\n\nHowever, the formation of the bull pennant pattern suggests that XRP is well-primed to continue its bull rally and move to $1. A rise to $1 will be significant for XRP, considering that it will be the first time that the crypto token has hit this price market since 2021. XRP failed to hit this price mark even when Judge Analisa Torres declared that the crypto token wasn’t a security last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Mikybull Crypto has suggested that XRP’s rise to $1 is just the beginning of the massive heights the crypto token will reach in this bull run. The analyst stated that XRP would surprise many doubters in this market cycle while also predicting that the coin could replicate its 2017 and rise to as high as $4 if a similar price movement eventually occurs.\n\nMikybull Crypto also recently affirmed his prediction that XRP would replicate its 2017 rally when the token enjoyed a price gain of over 61,000% in 280 days. In an X post, he stated that XRP is displaying “significant technical signs” that occurred in 2017 and led to these massive gains afterward. He added that historically, the chart always precedes the news, meaning that XRP is well set up for that catalyst that could spark such a run.\n\nA conclusion to the long-running legal battle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple is believed to be one factor that could spark such a parabolic rally for XRP. The case is expected to end soon enough, with the only thing remaining is a ruling from Judge Torres on the appropriate remedies to be awarded against Ripple.\n\nAt the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $0.59, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\n",

    "title": "Is Amazon Getting Serious About Blockchain? ",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Amazon has made blockchain tech overtures as early as 2017, but 2018 has seen it grow more aggressive in its forays into blockchain.\n\n",
    "content": "Even as blockchain continues to dominate headlines and conversations across the tech sphere, some of the biggest names in the industry remain on the outside of the sector looking in. However, following several high-profile announcements in recent months, it seems one of the top tech giants may finally be ready to dive into the field.\n\nAmazon, which ranks among the largest corporations in the world, has spent months exploring the possibilities of blockchain. Starting earlier in 2018, however, those explorations turned into real actions after the company announced several partnerships and plans that would put it squarely in the conversation of the sector’s future. With its new “Blockchain-as-a-Service” (BaaS) offering, the questions surrounding Amazon’s dalliance with blockchain go from the theoretical to the very practical.\n\nA Multi-Faceted Motivation\n\nThere is little question that blockchain is quickly becoming a profitable sector. While it was long tied to cryptocurrencies’ ebb and flow, the technology has since shed its chains and become a key driver of innovation. Most of the change and disruption has been propelled by developers, entrepreneurs and smaller companies, but large corporations have started to see both its value and virtue. This is evident from the many partnerships announced between blockchain startups and major corporations.\n\nFor Amazon, however, the need to incorporate blockchain tools has two distinct faces: changing trends in the eCommerce and consumer sector along with seeking avenues to expand its increasingly vital AWS platform.\n\nThe Changing Retail Game\n\nThere is little doubt Amazon still reigns supreme in online retail—the company accounted for nearly 44% of eCommerce sales in 2017, and a whopping 4% of all retail sales in the US.\n\nHowever, this dominance comes at a price, as most companies that operate their sales through Amazon highlight a major issue. According to Eran Eyal, CEO of blockchain-based customer intelligence firm Shopin, “Amazon presents a conundrum: While also providing a huge platform for wide product distribution, logistical support and marketing, all of this comes at the expense of a personalized relationship between the brand and their customers.”For many retailers, the biggest issue is the loss of end users’ information, which is collected by Amazon. This greatly hampers retailers’ sales ability considering most modern consumers prefer a personalized experience, which retailers through Amazon simply cannot deliver. According to an Accenture study, 91% of consumers prefer shopping with businesses that recognize them and remember their preferences, something Amazon precludes. More surprising, 83% of shoppers are happy to share their data if it means a better experience.\n\nIn lieu of gaining any concessions from Amazon’s data collection practices, many retailers are looking at alternatives, and blockchain is already providing them. Projects like Shopin, which rewards users for loyalty while providing retailers with vital information, are becoming more widespread. Other like Sandblock leverage loyalty programs to gather user data and deliver better services. For Amazon, working with these technologies would help them improve service both for consumers and the businesses that work through the platform. Even so, the company’s efforts still seem largely focused on the B2B opportunities blockchain affords for now.\n\nExpanding B2B Domination\n\nOn the business-to-business front, blockchain’s value to Amazon, and the company’s initial splash into the area, are much clearer. For one, the B2B realm has a much more developed ecosystem for blockchain, and Amazon’s existing platforms are already optimized to incorporate the technology. Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud server solution for businesses, has the pieces in place to easily adapt blockchain.\n\nThe company has also been aggressive in finding ready-made partners to integrate its new BaaS platform. For example, Amazon recently announced a partnership with the Qtum foundation to incorporate the project’s dApp development and smart contract tools into AWS. Qtum, which provides a blockchain optimized for business users, will help companies quickly create blockchain applications and smart contracts without having to handle the heavy lifting associated with infrastructure.\n\nMore importantly, perhaps, are the many opportunities still available in the business intelligence realm for B2B solutions. These include blockchain-based supercomputers that leverage existing network resources to reduce costs while supporting greater computational power. Platforms such as blockchain-based AI computing platform Tatau, for instance, which deploy unused resources on its blockchain for data processing and graphics rendering, could thrive on AWS’ massive network. Moreover, AWS could supply these services as part of larger BaaS offerings, or even as standalone services that reduce its operational costs and dispense tremendous value.\n\n“Consider that Amazon offers a huge range of services from streaming video, to cloud computing, to bricks and mortar retail. However, decentralized solutions will have a sustainable advantage over AWS in the foreseeable future as AWS runs a cost + model with slim margins and will not reduce prices significantly. This means that the decentralized players will always have a price advantage (which doesn\u0027t require returning hardware capital cost),\" said Martin Levy, the cofounder and CEO of Tatau.\n\nFor Amazon, entering the blockchain arena is more than an opportunity at this point—it has become a necessity. Several of its largest competitors in the computing and business services sectors have a head start as first movers and have already proven successful. IBM’s Hyperledger, for instance, continues to roll along, adding partners and expanding its reach. Network solutions provider Cisco has also had a service online since late 2017, and even Microsoft has entered the fray with its own enterprise blockchain.\n\n\"AWS is all about providing infrastructure as a service. Even though they have a nice set of proprietary services, their claim to fame is to deploy and scale any infrastructure service faster and easier than anyone out there. For example they are not shy to claim that “88% of TensorFlow projects run on AWS” being TensorFlow a proprietary technology of Google. So I think that AWS will (and probably is already) be very serious about being one of the best and easiest ways to deploy a blockchain based infrastructure. Not only providing templates, like they already do for ethereum and hyperledger, but as a full stack blockchain service interconnected with all other available products like storage, databases, development, machine learning and IoT,\" said Daniel Trachtenberg, CEO and Founder of Zinc, a user centric blockchain based advertising protocol and app.\n\nCan Amazon Catch Up?\n\nBy all accounts, Amazon is a late entrant to the blockchain environment. The company has made overtures as early as 2017, but 2018 has seen it grow more aggressive in its forays into blockchain. However, with the industry quickly taking a more solid shape, Amazon has its work cut out. While its use case in the B2B space is obvious, ignoring blockchain in the retail sector could be harmful over the long run for the ecommerce behemoth as shoppers demand a more personalized experience. While Amazon remains the de facto gatekeeper for most online retail, avoiding blockchain could derail this hegemony unless Amazon opts to join the race in a more serious fashion.\n\n",

    "content": "Solana continues to showcase a positive price movement as it outperforms the rest of the market. This recent surge in value allowed Solana to surpass Binance Coin (BNB) in market capitalization rankings last week, marking a significant milestone for the digital asset.\n\nDelving deeper into its performance, technical analysis suggests that Solana’s bullish trend is likely to persist into the coming week. Indicators point to sustained momentum, which could see its price continue to climb. Captain Faibik stands out with a particularly bold prediction. The crypto analyst forecasted a substantial rally for Solana, projecting its price could soar to as high as $1,000.\n\nTechnical analysis shared on social media platform X by renowned crypto analyst Captain Faibik has brought attention to a significant development for Solana’s price. According to his analysis, recent price movements have caused Solana to break out of a bullish pennant formation on the weekly timeframe. Bullish pennant patterns typically emerge after an uptrend and signal the continuation of this upward trend after a period of consolidation.\n\nFor Solana, the formation of this pattern began with a strong price rally that started in August of last year, culminating in a peak above $200 in April. Following this peak, Solana entered a consolidation phase characterized by progressively higher lows and lower highs, eventually reaching a low of $127.\n\nSolana is experiencing renewed bullish sentiment, indicating that the consolidation phase might be ending. The cryptocurrency has recently surged past $185 again, confirming the bullish pennant breakout identified by Captain Faibik.\n\n$SOL Bullish Pennant Upside Breakout has Confirmed on the Weekly timeframe..✅\n\nMassive Bullish Rally incoming..⌛️📈🚀#Crypto #SOL #Solana pic.twitter.com/9IT2o4Yafs\n\n— Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) July 27, 2024\n\nAt the time of writing, Solana is trading at $184, marking a 7% increase over the past seven days. Captain Faibik suggested that this breakout could lead to an extended rally for Solana, and he set a price target of $1,000. This represents a 446% increase from the current price level. While this may seem ambitious, other crypto analysts have made similar projections amidst the bullish sentiment. SOL would need to break above various price levels and walk into a new all-time high to hit this price point.\n\n\n\nIn addition to its price performance, Solana has experienced a significant surge in activity since the beginning of July. The number of daily active addresses has soared, reaching a new all-time high. At the time of writing, daily active SOL addresses stand above 2 million, which is a 38% increase from 1.45 million active addresses registered on July 10. This uptick in user activity further shows the growing interest and confidence in Solana within the crypto community.\n\nFeatured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "title": "Does Blockchain\u0027s Popularity Mean The End Of SWIFT?",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain is becoming popular with banks for cross-border transfers. Does this mean the end of SWIFT?\n\n",
    "content": "With its distributed ledger and ability to enable transactions with minimal fees, blockchain poses a tangible threat to cross-border funds transfer systems. And none of those systems is more threatened than SWIFT, a consortium of banks that manages a bulk of global transactions. (See also: \u0027Zero Knowledge Proofs\u0027 Could Boost Blockchain Adoption On Wall Street.)SWIFT’s messaging system enables interbank transfers across the world through its messaging system. Such cross-border payment transfers are an important part of the banking system today and amounted to $150 trillion in 2015. Blockchain technology also enables cross-border transfers, except in a decentralized fashion. This means that banks are connected directly to each other on the same network and transactions are approved directly. (See also: How the SWIFT System Works.)Recent SWIFT hacks have not helped matters and further compromised the network’s integrity. According to investment bank Credit Suisse, the traditional cross-border payments industry is ripe for disruption. “Interbank payment systems such as SWIFT are old, inflexible, slow, and increasingly prone to cyberattacks at a time when banks are under tremendous pressure to cut costs and protect customer data from hackers, which blockchain could achieve,” the bank posted on its site earlier this year.\n\nThe emergence of rival systems based on blockchain, such as Ripple – which has more than 75 banks as its members already – is also not helping matters. Large banks, such as JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co. (JPM), have also formed networks among themselves to develop cross-border payment systems based on blockchain technology. (See also: JPMorgan Unveils Blockchain Money Transfer Project.)SWIFT And Blockchain\n\nGiven the similarity in both payment systems\u0027 technologies, it would make sense for SWIFT to investigate blockchain. Indeed, the messaging network has initiated blockchain projects of its own. The consortium in January announced a proof of concept to test reconciliation of databases for cross-border payments in real time; by August, the project met its objectives. But that success came with a catch. In an interview with Coindesk, SWIFT’s R\u0026D head Damien Vanderveken said its solution would require a significant infrastructure overhaul for banks that had already invested in centralized solutions. “The business value depends on the level of automation of the participants,” he said.\n\nThe differences between SWIFT and blockchain came into sharp contrast at two competing conferences held at the same time last week. One of the conferences was organized by Ripple and the other by SWIFT. According to reports, SWIFT CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt compared the current enthusiasm for bitcoin, which is based on blockchain, to the 17th-century “Tulip bubble” mania and barely mentioned the company’s own blockchain project. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella set him right by asking the company to build “useful” blockchain applications.\n\nDoes This Mean The End Of SWIFT?\n\nTo be sure, the share of payment-based messages within the SWIFT ecosystem has been declining even as security and treasury transactions have been gaining share.\n\nHowever, the company’s SWIFT for Corporates solution, which is used by banks to exchange secure messages about financial information, has seen rapid growth from 579 corporate entities which signed up for the solution in 2009, to 1,405 in 2014. Traction for its new product and uptick in revenue from alternate streams means that SWIFT might be reinventing itself rather than becoming obsolete in a blockchain world.\n\n",

    "content": "In Nederland is het niet legaal om te wedden met crypto, er zijn dan ook geen casino’s met een licentie van de Nederlandse KSA die deze betalingsdienst ondersteunen. Nederlandse spelers die graag met valuta zoals Bitcoin of Ethereum willen crypto gokken, moeten daarom uitwijken naar buitenlandse bitcoin casinos.\n\nSpelen bij een buitenlands crypto casino nederland is niet altijd veilig. Daarom is het zeer belangrijk dat jij een betrouwbaar crypto casino uitkiest. In deze gids vertel ik hoe gok-experts de beste en veiligste crypto casinos selecteren. Ook zal ik bespreken wat de voor- en nadelen zijn van wedden bij een btc casino.\n\n🥇Monixbet \u003e\u003e Nieuw casino zonder vergunning \u003e\u003e Welkomstbonus van 275% tot €3000 en 265 gratis spins\n\n🥈1Red \u003e\u003e Nieuw casino zonder vergunning \u003e\u003e Welkomstbonus van 200% tot €9000\n\n🥉Rakoo casino \u003e\u003e Nieuw casino zonder vergunning \u003e\u003e Welkomstbonus van 210% tot €3000 en 300 gratis spins\n\n🏆Loki \u003e\u003e Nieuw casino zonder vergunning \u003e\u003e Welkomstbonus van 255% tot €18.000 en 230 gratis spins\n\n🏆Spinch \u003e\u003e Nieuw casino zonder vergunning \u003e\u003e Welkomstbonus van 225% tot €6000\n\n\n\nEen casino crypto is een goksite waar je met cryptocurrencies zoals Bitcoin, Ethereum of Ripple kunt betalen. Wanneer je cryptomunten aan je account toevoegt, wordt dit omgezet naar een valuta zoals euro’s of dollars. Spelletjes spelen bij het beste ethereum casino werkt dus vrijwel hetzelfde als in ieder Nederlands casino, de inzetten worden niet aangegeven in Bitcoin of andere cryptocurrencies.\n\nAllereerst is het belangrijk om te vertellen dat er geen cryptocurrency casinos zijn met een Nederlandse vergunning. wedden met cryptocurrencies is namelijk verboden in Nederland. Soms kun je bij een buitenlands online casino bitcoin wel gebruiken als betaalmiddel. Deze casino’s hoeven zich namelijk niet te houden aan de regels van de Nederlandse KSA.\n\nDe markt voor crypto currency casinos groeit exponentieel. Steeds meer spelers kiezen voor bitcoin casinos omdat deze vaak razendsnelle uitbetalingen, grote spel catalogussen en enorme welkomstbonussen hebben. Spelen bij een online crypto casino zonder Nederlandse licentie is echter niet altijd veilig. In het volgende hoofdstuk vertel ik hoe onze experts het beste crypto casino uit kiezen. Deze gids kan je natuurlijk zelf ook gebruiken in jouw zoektocht naar het beste online casino bitcoin.\n\n\n\nOnze crypto casino experts selecteren de beste bitcoin casinos aan de hand van een aantal eisen. Hierbij is veiligheid en betrouwbaarheid de belangrijkste factor. Het is essentieel dat je bij een crypto casino online speelt met een licentie van een betrouwbare buitenlandse KSA.\n\nDaarnaast vinden wij het belangrijk dat het online crypto casino moeite neemt om haar spelers te beschermen. Bijvoorbeeld door het beschikbaar stellen van spelers limieten, het beveiligen van gegevens en het aanbieden van eerlijke kansen.\n\nOok kijken we naar het aanbod van elk online casino bitcoin. We beoordelen bijvoorbeeld de spel catalogus, hoe goed de promoties zijn en welke betalingsmethoden en cryptocurrencies er allemaal beschikbaar zijn.\n\nIn de onderstaande lijst zie je een korte samenvatting van waar wij het meest op letten. Verder in het artikel vertel ik precies waarom dit belangrijk is, en waar je rekening mee moet houden.\n\nwedden met crypto is niet toegestaan in Nederland. Een crypto casino is daarom nooit in het bezit van een licentie van de Nederlandse KSA. De beste crypto casinos hebben een licentie van een betrouwbare kansspelautoriteit, zoals die van Malta, Curacao of het Verenigd Koninkrijk. De licentie van een crypto casino staat vrijwel altijd onderaan de thuispagina vermeld.\n\nHier vind je het licentienummer, van welke KSA deze afkomstig is en of het casino deel is van een grotere casinogroep. Dit laatste is een goed teken, dit betekent namelijk dat het moederbedrijf ervaring heeft met het aanbieden van kansspelen. Als je twijfels hebt over de veiligheid van een bitcoin casino online, is het een goed idee om even te controleren of het licentienummer wel klopt. Dit kan je doen op de website van de desbetreffende KSA.\n\nJe komt af en toe ook weleens een crypto casino tegen dat helemaal niet over een licentie beschikt. Dit zijn geen veilige aanbieders, spelen bij een buitenlands online crypto casino zonder licentie raad ik daarom altijd af. In de onderstaande lijst vind je de KSA’s die je het meest tegenkomt tijdens het spelen bij een online casino bitcoin. Ook kan je lezen hoe betrouwbaar deze partijen zijn en wat uniek is aan hun aanbod.\n\nEen licentie van de KSA van Curaçao is redelijk betrouwbaar. Deze vergunning is erg aantrekkelijk voor een crypto casino, omdat de belastingen voor kansspelen in Curaçao relatief laag zijn. Een nadeel aan een casino met een Curaçaose licentie is dat deze KSA spelers meestal niet ondersteunt als ze problemen krijgen met een online casino. In dit geval ben je dus aangewezen op de klantenservice van de aanbieder. Crypto gokken is legaal in Curaçao, en dus mogelijk bij haar licentiehouders.\n\nDe MGA is waarschijnlijk de beste en betrouwbaarste buitenlandse kansspelautoriteit, ze werken zelfs samen met de Nederlandse KSA. Licentiehouders van de MGA moeten aan strenge eisen rondom het beschermen van gegevens en het aanbieden van eerlijke spellen voldoen. Licentiehouders van de MGA mogen wedden met cryptocurrencies aanbieden. In sommige gevallen zal de MGA spelers ook bijstaan in een dispuut met een bitcoin casino nederland, bijvoorbeeld als je een klacht hebt over een onvoltooide uitbetaling.\n\nDe KSA van Gibraltar kom je vandaag de dag niet meer heel vaak tegen bij top bitcoin casinos. Deze partijen is vooral bekend omdat zij veel licenties verlenen aan de eerste online casino’s. Alhoewel een licentie van de GRA zeldzaam is, is deze zeker betrouwbaar. Helaas is wedden met cryptocurrency in Gibraltar momenteel niet toegestaan, en dus ook niet mogelijk bij casino’s met een licentie van de GRA.\n\nEen licentie van de UKGC is naast die van Nederland en Malta waarschijnlijk het veiligst. Dit is de officiële KSA van het Verenigd Koninkrijk, en dit land heeft vrij strenge eisen rondom online wedden. Wedden op sportwedstrijden is enorm populair in Engeland, en vergunninghouders van de UKGC hebben dan ook vaak een sportsbook sectie. Gokken met cryptocurrencies is toegestaan in Engeland, en kan dus bij een UKGC gelicenseerd casino.\n\nDe AGCC is nog een KSA uit het Verenigd Koninkrijk. Deze is niet deel van de UKGC, maar wordt hier wel door erkend. De licenties van de AGCC zijn dus ongeveer net zo betrouwbaar. Ook deze KSA staat het wedden met crypto toe, en je ziet deze betaaldienst dan ook regelmatig bij haar aandeelhouders terug.\n\nAls je gokt bij een top bitcoin casino, kan je in principe altijd anoniem spelen. Aangezien de transacties via de blockchain plaatsvinden, hoef je bijvoorbeeld geen bankgegevens aan te leveren en dus loop je ook niet het risico dat deze in de foute handen vallen. Ook is het mogelijk om alle stortingen en opnames in te zien via de blockchain. Hier heb je dus in de blockchain altijd bewijs van.\n\nToch is het zo dat de beste online casino’s weleens het doelwit zijn van cyber aanvallen. Gelukkig treft het beste crypto casino maatregelen om succesvolle blockchain aanvallen te voorkomen, zoals geavanceerde beveiligingsmaatregelen en geëncrypteerde blockchain gegevens. Je kan zelf altijd even controleren of het casino over externe veiligheidscertificaten beschikt en of de verbinding beveiligd is. Als er een gesloten slotje links naast de url staat, is de verbinding beveiligd.\n\nEen van de belangrijkste dingen die je moet checken als je wilt gaan spelen bij een online casino bitcoin, is de mening van spelers. Dit kan bijvoorbeeld op Trustpilot. Trustpilot bitcoin casino reviews geven je vaak inzicht in hoe goed een casino scoort op verschillende vlakken zoals uitbetalingen, klantenservice en spelaanbod.\n\nHoud er wel rekening mee dat Trustpilot reviews ook gekleurd kunnen zijn. Spelers hebben bijvoorbeeld snel de neiging om casino’s te beschuldigen van oneerlijke spelelementen als ze grote sommen geld verliezen. Dit is natuurlijk het risico van gokken, en het is niet helemaal eerlijk om een casino hier op af te rekenen.\n\nVeel spelers kiezen voor een crypto online casino vanwege de flexibele blockchain betalingsmethodes. Uiteraard kan je bij een online casino bitcoin betalen met cryptocurrencies. Meestal zijn er echter nog veel meer betalingsmethodes beschikbaar zoals Skrill, Neteller en PaySafeCard. Deze zijn niet beschikbaar bij een casino in Nederland.\n\nIn de onderstaande tabel zie je een overzicht van betaalmethodes die je veel tegenkomt bij een crypto online casino..\n\nJe balans aanvullen met cryptocurrencies bij een crypto casino werkt ongeveer hetzelfde als een normale storting:\n\n– Hiervoor hoef je alleen een account aan te maken, en in je accountinstellingen naar het kopje ‘deposit’ of ‘storten’ te gaan.\n\n– Vervolgens kies je ervoor om te storten met jouw gewenste blockchain cryptovaluta, zoals Ethereum of Bitcoin.\n\n– Je kan nu een storting doen met gebruik van je crypto wallet.\n\n– Blockchain technologie is erg snel, en jouw cryptomunt wordt meestal vrijwel direct aan je balans toegevoegd. Deze wordt omgezet naar USD of EUR. Bij een online bitcoin casino gok je namelijk nooit echt met cryptomunten. Hoeveel er op je balans komt, is afhankelijk van de huidige koers.\n\n– Zodra je balans is aangevuld, kan je beginnen met spelen.\n\nBitcoin is waarschijnlijk de bekendste cryptovaluta, je kan achter bij een online casino bitcoin vrijwel altijd betalen met een breed scala digitale blockchain munten. Ik heb de populairste opties hieronder voor je op een rij gezet.\n\nAls je aan crypto denkt, denk je eigenlijk automatisch aan Bitcoin. Dit is de blockchain cryptomunt met de hoogste koers, en een van de populairste blockchain cryptocurrencies om mee te betalen. Je kan eigenlijk bij elk crypto casino wel betalen met Bitcoin. Als je graag wilt gaan gokken met crypto is bitcoin dus een uitstekende keuze.\n\nEen nadeel van Bitcoin is wel dat de prijs erg volatiel is. De prijs ondergaat vrijwel constant kleine veranderingen. Hou dus goed de koers in de gaten voor je Bitcoin stort bij een online casino bitcoin zodat je precies weet hoeveel geld je op je balans kunt verwachten.\n\nEthereum is na Bitcoin de grootste crypto munt. Ethereum is vrij uniek, omdat het over eigen blockchain technologie beschikt. Ethereum is erg populair om in te beleggen, maar uiteraard kunnen hier ook blockchain betalingen mee worden verricht. Aangezien dit na Bitcoin de grootste blockchain crypto munt is, vindt je deze ook bij vrijwel elk crypto online casino.\n\nRipple is de betaling technologie achter RXP. RXP is een relatief nieuwe cryptomunt die de laatste jaren sterk in populariteit toeneemt. RXP werkt iets anders dan Bitcoin, het gebruik maakt namelijk geen gebruik van blockchain technologie. Zij hebben namelijk een eigen systeem voor het afhandelen van transacties: ‘distributed ledger technology’.\n\nTransacties met Bitcoin worden opgeslagen in de blockchain en worden publiek gemaakt. Dit is bij Monero niet het geval. Monero maakt gebruik van cryptografie om de bedragen en adressen van de transacties te beschermen. Dit maakt het gebruik van Monero extra anoniem. De crypto munt van Monero heet XMR.\n\nUSDT is het bedrijf achter Tether. Tether is gekoppeld aan de Amerikaanse dollar. En dit maakt deze blockchain munt een stuk stabieler dan andere crypto valuta. Elke keer dat er 1 dollar wordt uitgegeven via Tether, slaat USDT fysiek 1 dollar op. Dit heet ook wel een stable blockchain coin.\n\nWanneer jij als speler klachten hebt over een Nederlands casino, bijvoorbeeld als je niet bent uitbetaald, kan je naar de Nederlandse KSA toestappen. Zij zullen vervolgens hun best doen om enige problemen tussen jou en het casino op te lossen.\n\nHier kun je bij een crypto currency casino niet altijd op rekenen. Buitenlandse KSA’s ondersteunen spelers in sommige gevallen, maar dit is bij lange na niet altijd het geval.\n\nAls je dus een klacht hebt, ben je meestal aangewezen op de klantenservice van het beste online crypto casino.\n\nDaarom is het belangrijk dat je speelt bij een crypto casino dat beschikt over een snelle en betrouwbare klantenservice. Deze kan je het beste zelf testen. De snelste manier om een medewerker te spreken bij een online casino bitcoin is meestal via de live chat. Deze kan je testen nadat je een account hebt aangemaakt. Let op hoe snel de klantenservice reageert, maar ook hoeveel informatie de medewerkers je kunnen bieden.\n\nDe Nederlandse KSA houdt haar licentiehouders aan strenge regels wat betreft het eerlijk verloop van gokspelletjes. De beste casino’s met een Nederlandse vergunning betalen externe bedrijven om hun spelletjes te testen. Deze partijen keren certificaten uit wanneer er wordt vastgesteld dat de spellen de RTP’s naar waarheid weergeven.\n\nBuitenlandse KSA’s zijn in dit opzicht iets minder streng. Er zijn een stuk meer licentiehouders, controle is dus ook een stuk ingewikkelder. Toch beschikt een bitcoin online casino soms over externe veiligheidscertificaten. Je kan checken of deze op de website te vinden zijn, ze staan meestal onderaan de thuispagina.\n\nAls je wilt weten of een crypto casino eerlijke kansen heeft, kan je ook kijken of het spellen aanbiedt van gerenommeerde iGaming providers. Bedrijven zoals Pragmatic Play, NetEnt en Microgaming zullen niet snel partneren met een online casino bitcoin dat spelers bedriegt.\n\nTijdens het maken van een account bij een Nederlands casino moet je altijd spelers limieten instellen. Deze spelers limieten zijn wettelijk verplicht, en zijn bedoeld om problematisch gokgedrag te voorkomen. Een crypto casino hoeft zich niet aan deze regels te houden, en het instellen van spelers limieten is dus eigenlijk nooit verplicht.\n\nToch raad ik je aan te spelen bij een online casino bitcoin dat je wel de mogelijkheid geeft je eigen spelers limieten in te stellen. Als deze beschikbaar zijn, vindt je ze in je accountinstellingen. Als je dan toch gaat spelen zonder spelers limieten, kan je het beste een budget en speeltijd bepalen voor je begint met gokken bij een crypto casino.\n\nEen van de voordelen van een online casino bitcoin is dat de bonussen vaak veel guller zijn dan bij de beste Nederlandse casino’s. Dit heeft vooral te maken met beperkingen van de Nederlandse KSA. De bonusbedragen die een Nederlandse casino mag uitkeren zijn beperkt, en cashback bonussen zijn verboden.\n\nIk heb ook gemerkt dat vrijwel elk online casino bitcoin een VIP programma heeft, dit is absoluut niet het geval bij Nederlandse aanbieders. Hieronder heb ik een overzicht samengesteld van de populairste crypto casino bonussen, inclusief de kleine letters.\n\nGeen stortingsbonussen zijn erg zeldzaam in Nederland. Het enige Nederlandse casino wat over een dergelijke bonus beschikt is OneCasino, en het bonusbedrag is nogal bescheiden. Deze bonus is niet zeldzaam bij een online casino bitcoin, en erg populair. De geen stortingsbonus is een van mijn favoriete bonussen omdat deze je in staat stelt het aanbod van een crypto casino te testen zonder geld te investeren.\n\nEen Nederlands casino mag volgens regels van de Nederlandse Reclame Code een bonus van maximaal €250 uitkeren. Bij een online casino bitcoin is het niet gek om een bonus van €3000 of meer tegen te komen, een stuk meer dus. De doorspeel vereiste bij dergelijke bonussen is meestal wel een stuk hoger, dus het laten uitbetalen van het bonusgeld is een stuk lastiger.\n\nCashback bonussen zijn niet toegestaan volgens de wetten van de Nederlandse KSA. De reden hiervoor is dat ze aanzetten tot onverantwoord speelgedrag. Een crypto casino hoeft zich niet aan deze regels te houden.\n\nCashback bonussen zijn erg populair onder spelers, deze stellen je namelijk in staat om een deel van je verloren inzet terug te krijgen. Een cashback bonus heeft vaak lage doorspeel vereisten. In dat geval is het vrij makkelijk om je geld dus weer terug te boeken. Cashback bonussen zijn bij een online casino bitcoin vaak deel van het VIP programma.\n\nDit houdt in dat je een hogere cashback bonus kan vrijspelen door meer geld in te zetten bij het casino. Deze beginnen vaak bij 2% en kunnen oplopen tot wel 20%. De hoge cashback bonussen zijn dus meestal alleen beschikbaar voor high rollers.\n\nVIP programma’s zijn bij Nederlandse casino’s niet geheel ongekend. Toch bieden de meeste legale goksites deze feature niet aan. Een crypto casino heeft echter vrijwel altijd een VIP programma. Het VIP programma van een online casino bitcoin is meestal niet heel ingewikkeld. Je krijgt meestal een bepaald aantal punten voor elke euro die je inzet.\n\nBij een bepaalde inzet, ga je een rang omhoog en kan je nieuwe diensten vrijspelen. Je kan bijvoorbeeld prijzen zoals extra cashback, gratis spins of een persoonlijke VIP manager ontvangen. VIP programma’s klinken altijd heel goed, maar vaak moet je enorme bedragen investeren om de voordelen vrij te spelen. Ik raad je dus aan om altijd goed de voorwaarden door te lezen.\n\nEen crypto casino heeft vaak een veel grotere spel catalogus dan een Nederlands casino. Dit komt doordat de beste Nederlandse casino’s alleen spellen mogen aanbieden van software ontwikkelaars die zijn goedgekeurd door de Nederlandse KSA. Er is een enorme groep kleine buitenlandse studio’s die dit recht nog niet hebben ontvangen. Deze aanbieders vind je vaak wel bij een online casino bitcoin.\n\nHet aanbod bij een online casino bitcoin is hierdoor groter, maar de types spellen die je vindt zijn doorgaans hetzelfde. De meeste bitcoin casinos focussen zich op online slots en live casino game’s. Veel hebben namelijk geen sportsbook secties.\n\nAlhoewel je bij een crypto casino dezelfde spelletjes als bij Nederlandse aanbieders kan spelen, werken sommige dingen wel iets anders. De beste Nederlandse casino’s mogen volgens de wetgeving van de KSA geen bonus buy feature aanbieden. Met een bonus buy kan je voor een vast bedrag direct toegang krijgen tot de gratis spins bonus game van een online slot.\n\nDeze bonus is mega populair, aangezien de gratis spins bonus game vaak het leukste deel van een gokkast is. Volgens de KSA moedigt de bonus buy echter onverantwoordelijk spelgedrag aan. Er zijn momenteel geen andere KSA’s die de bonus buy feature hebben verboden. Als je dus speelt bij een crypto casino nederland is deze altijd beschikbaar.\n\nOok het toevoegen van autospins is verboden in Nederland om dezelfde reden. Dit is een erg handige en zeer gewilde feature. Deze is voor Nederlanders dus alleen beschikbaar bij een online casino bitcoin met een buitenlandse licentie.\n\nHieronder heb ik een lijst samengesteld van de populairste spellen bij een online casino bitcoin:\n\nOnline slots blijven toch de grootste bezienswaardigheid bij de beste online casino’s. Een btc casino heeftvaak een enorme slots catalogus, omdat zij samenwerken met een enorm aantal software providers. Niet alleen het aantal spelletjes is belangrijk, maar ook de kwaliteit hiervan.\n\nDe beste gok experts beoordelen online slots voornamelijk op het uitbetalings percentage en variantie. Deze geven aan hoeveel van je inzet je ongeveer terug krijgt, en hoe vaak een gokkast uitbetaald. Vaak hebben de online slots van de beste bedrijven zoals NetEnt, Microgaming en Playtech de beste RTP’s. Let dus vooral op of een online casino bitcoin spellen van deze bedrijven aanbiedt als je een aanbieder aan het inspecteren bent.\n\nPoker blijft een van de meest iconische en meest gerenommeerde gokspellen. Vrijwel elk btc casino heeft tegenwoordig een live casino sectie, en hier horen ook poker games bij. De keuze is eigenlijk altijd vrij groot. Er zijn namelijk veel verschillende varianten van dit klassieke spel. Zo vind je bijvoorbeeld pokertafels met een hoge minimum inzet, speciaal voor echte high rollers. Soms zijn bij een casino btc zelfs poker tafels in verschillende talen te vinden.\n\nVrijwel iedere Nederlander kent dit klassieke spel. Bingo zie je echt ook steeds vaker bij het beste crypto casino. Online werkt dit spel vrijwel hetzelfde als in het echt. Je kan voor een vast bedrag een kaart kopen. Vervolgens worden er willekeurige nummers omgeroepen. Jij kan als speler dit nummer automatisch af laten kruisen, maar je kan er ook voor kiezen om dit handmatig te doen.\n\nZodra jij een gevulde rij of kaart hebt, kan je een prijs winnen. Niet elk online casino bitcoin biedt Bingo aan. Als je dit spel graag wilt spelen is het dus handig om even goed onderzoek te doen.\n\nRoulette is vooral geliefd onder beginnende gokkers, zeker ook bij een top crypto casino. De regels van dit tafelspel zijn namelijk erg simpel en je kan vaak al meespelen met een relatief lage inzet. Een crypto casino heeft meestal tientallen roulette spellen. De populairste roulette game is waarschijnlijk Lightning Roulette van Evolution.\n\nDit is een unieke versie van roulette met de beste bonus features. Dit houdt in dat specifieke nummers kunnen zorgen voor extra hoge uitbetalingen. Deze multipliers kunnen oplopen tot wel 500x. Naast Lightning Roulette vindt je bijvoorbeeld roulette tafels met extra snelle rondes of lage minimum inzetten.\n\nSportweddenschappen zijn enorm populair onder Nederlanders, en beste Nederlandse casino’s beschikken dan ook over een uitstekende sportsbook sectie. Sportweddenschappen zijn iets zeldzamer bij top bitcoin casinos, maar niet geheel ongekend.\n\nAls je wilt spelen bij een online casino bitcoin met een sportsbook sectie, kan je het beste kijken naar top crypto casinos met een licentie van de UKGC. Dit is de KSA van het Verenigd Koninkrijk, waar sportsbooksecties ook zeer gewild zijn.\n\nOnze casino experts vergelijken de odds van elk crypto casino om de beste aanbieder te vinden. Als jij dus op zoek bent naar het beste online casino bitcoin voor sportweddenschappen kan je naar het onderstaande overzicht kijken.\n\nBitcoin casinos hebben dus een grotere spel catalogus omdat ze meestal met meer software providers samenwerken dan een Nederlands casino. Elk noemenswaardig crypto casino waar je met bitcoin kan betalen biedt echter ook spellen aan van de beste studio’s zoals NetEnt, Pragmatic Play en Evolution.\n\nWanneer een crypto casino games van deze ontwikkelaars aanbiedt, is dit altijd een teken dat dit een veilig online casino bitcoin is. Deze gerenommeerde iGaming ontwikkelaars moeten ervoor zorgen dat hun reputatie niet beschadigd wordt. Ze zullen dus niet zo snel samenwerken met een onbetrouwbaar crypto casino.\n\nEen ander voordeel van spelen bij een top crypto casino, is dat de catalogus constant uitgebreid wordt. Omdat de verscheidenheid aan software ontwikkelaars enorm is, kunnen zij vaak de nieuwste en beste casino games aanbieden.\n\nHieronder heb ik een overzicht samengesteld van de meest veilige software providers. Ook kan je hier lezen wat de beste spellen van deze aanbieders zijn.\n\nNetEnt is een iconisch bedrijf in het online gok landschap. Zij ontwikkelen al jaren de beste online slots, en hebben vele klassiekers in hun catalogus staan. Een aantal kasten die je waarschijnlijk al kent zijn Gonzo’s Quest, Starburst en Hall of Gods. NetEnt staat synoniem voor leuke games met goede uitbetalingen. Het is dan ook geen verrassing dat spelers steeds terug blijven komen bij deze studio.\n\nDit zijn de online slots van NetEnt met de beste uitbetalingen:\n\n– Mega Joker (99%)\n\n– Blood Suckers (98%)\n\n– Steam Tower (97,04%)\n\nDe gemiddelde online slot heeft een Return to Player percentage van ongeveer 96%. Dit getal geeft aan hoeveel geld je waarschijnlijk zal terugkrijgen voor iedere euro die je in zet. Deze getallen worden berekend over een zeer lange speeltijd, jouw ervaring kan dus natuurlijk afwijken.\n\nIk heb al heel wat online slot reviews geschreven. Eerlijk gezegd kom je vrij zelden een gokkast tegen met een RTP hoger dan 97%. De online slots van NetEnt zijn dus echt een uitzondering.\n\nMicrograming is bijna net zo bekend als NetEnt. Zij focussen zich echter op een ander soort spel. Net als NetEnt maken ze voornamelijk online slots, hun gokkasten hebben echter meestal een erg hoge variantie. De variantie van een online slot geeft aan hoe vaak deze uitbetaald, en hoe hoog de uitbetalingen zijn.\n\nGokkasten met een lage variantie betalen vaak uit, maar de bedragen die je hier kan winnen zijn meestal niet erg groot. Bij een online slot met een hoge variantie kan je enorme bedragen winnen (soms wel 15.000x je inzet), alleen de betalingen zijn erg onregelmatig. Het kan dus zomaar gebeuren dat je 50 spins doet met weinig tot geen winnende combinaties als resultaat.\n\nDe kasten van Microgaming zijn dan ook vooral populair bij spelers die specifiek naar deze eigenschap op zoek zijn. Hieronder heb ik een lijst samengesteld met gokkasten van Microgaming met de beste RTP’s:\n\n– Mega Moolah (96,98%)\n\n– Thunderstruck II (96,5%)\n\n– Break Da Bank Again (96,15%)\n\nZoals je ziet liggen de RTP percentages een stuk lager dan die van NetEnt. Spelers die dus vooral economisch verantwoord willen spelen kunnen beter bij kasten van een andere aanbieder wedden.\n\nNiet alle gokkers kennen Betsoft, deze partij is namelijk iets minder populair dan de twee eerder genoemde bedrijven. Onder gok experts wordt het aanbod echter geprezen vanwege hun goede uitbetalingspercentages, unieke spelelementen en betrouwbare reputatie. Betsoft blink in principe nergens in uit, maar scoort op vrijwel alle vlakken bovengemiddeld.\n\nDe beste Betsoft spellen met de hoogste uitbetalingspercentages zijn:\n\n– Quest To The West (97,52%)\n\n– At The Copa (97,42%)\n\n– Gypsy Rose (96,63%)\n\nAls je de spellen van Betsoft eens wilt uitproberen bij een crypto casino, raad ik Charms and Treasures aan. Charms and Treasures beschikt over de in Nederland verboden bonus buy feature. Dit is dus het uitgelezen moment om deze even te testen als je aan het gokken bent met Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nDe Nederlandse KSA schat dat ongeveer 10% van de Nederlandse gokkers speelt bij een crypto casino nederland. Het beste bitcoin casino hoeft zich niet aan de strenge regels van de Nederlandse KSA te houden. Ze kunnen dus meer spellen, de beste bonussen en unieke features aanbieden. Een online casino bitcoin valt ook in deze categorie.\n\nHoeveel Nederlandse spelers wedden bij een crypto casino, kan ik niet met zekerheid zeggen. Ik kan wel een inschatting maken over waarom sommige Nederlanders kiezen voor een online casino bitcoin. De meest voor de hand liggende reden is dat het simpelweg niet mogelijk is om te gokken met Bitcoin in Nederland.\n\nEr zijn verschillende redenen waarom wedden met Bitcoin of andere cryptocurrencies interessant kan zijn. Het is erg anoniem, je hoeft namelijk geen bankgegevens aan te leveren. Daarnaast zijn transacties met cryptocurrencies erg snel, zowel stortingen als uitbetalingen gebeuren vrijwel direct.\n\nAlle betalingen die gebeuren met crypto worden opgeslagen in een zogeheten ledger. Deze lijst is publiekelijk inzichtelijk. Dit maakt het iets minder anoniem, maar dit zorgt er wel voor dat je altijd een betaalbewijs hebt. Als jij bijvoorbeeld geld hebt gestort op de website van een top bitcoin casino maar het niet op je balans verschijnt, heb je een betalingsbewijs. Bij problemen met opnames kan dit ook handig zijn. In de publieke lijst kan je namelijk ook de voortgang van een transactie bekijken.\n\nNaast deze voordelen die direct aan het gebruik van Bitcoin of andere crypto verbonden zijn, zijn er ook een aantal voordelen die je altijd meepikt als je speelt bij een crypto currency casino. Het beste bitcoin casino biedt meer spellen aan, heeft de beste bonussen en mag een bonus buy feature aan zijn spellen toevoegen.\n\nToch zijn hier ook nadelen aan verbonden. Sommige buitenlandse top crypto casinos hebben geen licentie. Zelfs als ze een licentie hebben, is gokken bij een Nederlands casino altijd veiliger. Het is namelijk het doel van de kansspelautoriteit om Nederlandse spelers te beschermen. Ook stellen zij zeer strenge eisen aan hun licentiehouders.\n\nHieronder heb ik een lijst samengesteld van de voor- en nadelen van spelen bij een online bitcoin casino:\n\n– Stortingen en opnames gebeuren vrijwel direct\n\n– Met Bitcoin kan je anoniem wedden, je hoeft namelijk geen bankgegevens aan te leveren\n\n– Een online casino bitcoin heeft vaak de beste bonussen\n\n– Een crypto casino mag cashback bonussen aanbieden\n\n– Spellen bij een online casino bitcoin hebben een bonus buy en autospin feature\n\n– Vaak hoef je geen ID kaart aan te leveren, registreren is dus een stuk sneller\n\n– Je transacties worden opgeslagen in een publieke lijst, je hebt dus altijd een betalingsbewijs\n\n– Er zijn meestal geen transactiekosten\n\n– Het aantal bitcoin online casinos neemt exponentieel toe\n\n– Een online casino bitcoin heeft vaak een grote spel catalogus\n\n– Het beste crypto casino heeft vaak een VIP programma\n\n– Soms heeft een online casino bitcoin geen reguliere betalingsmethoden\n\n– wedden met crypto is illegaal in Nederland\n\n– Crypto is erg volatiel\n\n– Wedden bij een crypto casino nederland is altijd minder veilig dan bij een Nederlandse aanbieder\n\n– Spelerslimieten zijn niet verplicht, en soms niet beschikbaar\n\n– De website en klantenservice zijn Engelstalig\n\n– Je kan vaak niet met iDeal betalen\n\n– In sommige gevallen moet je zelf belasting aangeven\n\n\n\nJe weet nu waar je rekening mee moet houden als je gaat spelen bij een bitcoin casino nederland. Toch kan het vinden van het beste online casino bitcoin vrij lastig zijn, het aanbod is namelijk enorm. Geen zorgen, ik heb tientallen aanbieders getest en een lijst samengesteld van de beste bitcoin online casinos. Hieronder zie je mijn aanbevelingen en kan je lezen waarom specifiek deze aanbieders zo fantastisch zijn.\n\n\n\nMonixbet wordt beheerd door moederbedrijf FGS SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS S.R.L. Deze partij beheert meerdere buitenlandse casino’s, en heeft dus aardig wat ervaring met het aanbieden van online kansspellen. Dit zorgt ervoor dat Monixbet een uitermate betrouwbaar casino is. FGS SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS S.R.L. is in het bezit van een licentie van de KSA van Costa Rica, dit is ook waar het crypto casino gevestigd is.\n\nHet aanbod van Monixbet is gefocust op gokkasten en live casino games. In de live casino sectie kan je genieten van tafelspellen en game shows onder begeleiding van live hosts. De live casino sectie wordt verzorgd door Evolution en Pragmatic Play. Dit zijn de twee beste aanbieders in deze categorie. Monixbet heeft dus een uitstekende live casino sectie.\n\nDe online slots sectie van Monixbet is ook van de bovenste plank. Wat me vooral opviel is dat ze samenwerken met een enorm aantal software providers. Je kan hier spelletjes spelen van de beste aanbieders zoals NetEnt, Betsoft en RelaxGaming. Er is echter ook een groot aantal kleinere studio’s beschikbaar. Veel van deze zijn nog niet legaal in Nederland. Dit maakt de slots sectie van Monixbet extra interessant.\n\nNieuwe spelers kunnen bij Monixbet gebruikmaken van de welkomstbonus. Dit betreft een stortingsbonus die verdeeld is over je eerste 4 stortingen, met een gezamenlijke waarde van 275%. Met deze bonus kan je maximaal €3000 vrijspelen, en hier krijg je ook nog een 265 gratis spins bij.\n\nJe kan bij Monixbet betalen met verschillende cryptovaluta waaronder Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, BCH, DOGE en USDT. Tijdens het spelen kan je ook gebruikmaken van de wekelijkse cashback bonus. Hoe hoog je cashback is, is afhankelijk van je rang in het VIP programma.\n\nJe kan rangen omhoog gaan door geld in te zetten bij Monixbet. Zodra je de tweede rang hebt bereikt, heb je recht op 2% cashback. Als het je lukt om de hoogste rang te bereiken, kan je iedere week 20% cashback claimen. Dit houdt in dat je 20% van je inzet die week terugkrijgt. De cashback bonus moet wel geactiveerd worden door minimaal €20 te storten.\n\nAls je de Trustpilot recensies van Monixbet leest, zie je dat de meeste gebruikers erg positief zijn over dit online casino bitcoin. Monixbet krijgt vooral een hoge beoordeling vanwege de nette website, verschillende spelcategorieën en de hoge bonussen.\n\n\n\n1Red casino is in het bezit van een licentie van de KSA van Curaçao, en dit is dan ook waar hun hoofdkantoor gevestigd is. 1Red Casino heeft een zeer gulle welkomstbonus, die je kan claimen na het aanmaken van een nieuw account. Dit is een drievoudige stortingsbonus met een totale waarde van 200%. Als je deze bonus claimt, kan je hier in totaal €9000 bonustegoed mee vrijspelen. Jammer genoeg zijn er geen gratis spins verbonden aan de welkomstbonus.\n\nDe website van 1Red zal Nederlandse spelers waarschijnlijk bekend voorkomen. De stijl is namelijk vergelijkbaar met veel Hollandse casino’s. Het aanbod van 1Red is erg divers, je vindt hier een online slots, live casino en sportsbook sectie. Er zijn niet heel veel crypto casinos netherlands waar je kan wedden op sportwedstrijden. Spelers die graag willen wedden met Bitcoin, en een gokje willen wagen op hun favoriete team, kunnen dus goed terecht bij 1Red.\n\nOok terugkerende spelers worden in het zonnetje gezet bij 1Red. Naast de welkomstbonus zijn er iedere week verschillende promoties beschikbaar. Net zoals Moninxbet heeft 1Red een cashback bonus. Deze werkt echter iets anders, het is namelijk een dagelijkse bonus. Ook bij 1Red is de hoogte van de uitbetaling afhankelijk van je rand in het VIP programma. Deze kan oplopen tot 20%.\n\nMaar 1Red heeft nog meer cadeaus voor trouwe gasten. Op woensdag kan je gratis spins vrij spelen door een bescheiden storting te doen. In het weekend kan je je balans bijvullen door middel van een reload bonus.\n\n\n\nHet aanbod van Rakoo Casino is een echte verwenning voor liefhebbers van online slots. Deze aanbieder met een Curaçaose licentie beschikt over een van de beste catalogussen met meer dan 5000 titels. Bij Rakoo Casino zijn vrijwel alle bekende iGaming ontwikkelaars aangesloten, waaronder NetEnt, Spribe en Evolution. Dit maakt hun website zeer veilig en betrouwbaar\n\nJe kan gebruik maken van de uitstekende welkomstbonus om je balans aardig aan te dikken. Ze bieden namelijk meerdere stortingsbonussen aan met een totale waarde van 210%, hiermee kan je maximaal €3000 bonustegoed en 300 gratis spins vrijspelen.\n\nJe kan ook iedere week mooie prijzen claimen. Als je op maandag een storting van minimaal €100 voltooid, speel je 100 gratis spins vrij. Net als de eerder genoemde aanbieders kan je ook cashback claimen. Dit kan iedere dinsdag, de maximale waarde van de cashback is 20%. Zoals je misschien al verwachtte is de cashback verbonden aan het VIP programma. Door geld in te zetten bij dit crypto casino Netherlands ga je rangen omhoog, en kan je hogere cashback bedragen vrijspelen.\n\nAls je alle voordelen van Rakoo Casino leest, is het eigenlijk geen verrassing dat zij gemiddeld een 4 scoren op Trustpilot. Gebruikers zijn met name te spreken over het VIP programma, en specifiek over de persoonlijke VIP managers. Als je de hogere rangen van het VIP programma weet te bereiken, kan een VIP manager jou persoonlijke promoties en adviezen aanbieden. Ook kan de VIP manager je helpen als je vragen hebt over een uitbetaling of promotie.\n\n\n\nLoki Casino is in het bezit van licentie van de KSA van Curaçao, dit maakt het een betrouwbaar online casino bitcoin. Loki Casino staat bekend om hun torenhoge welkomstbonus. Nieuwe spelers kunnen bij Loki namelijk een stortingsbonus van 255% claimen, hiermee kan je maximaal €18.000 en 230 gratis spins vrijspelen. Om het maximale bedrag te kunnen claimen moet je zelf natuurlijk ook een vrij hoge storting doen. Dit maakt de bonus van Loki Casino vooral interessant voor spelers met een groot budget.\n\nWat de website van Loki nog aantrekkelijker maakt, is de enorme slots selectie. Er zijn namelijk meer dan 6000 titels om uit te kiezen. Loki ondersteunt een verscheidenheid aan betaalmethoden, waaronder verschillende cryptocurrencies zoals Ethereum, Litecoin en natuurlijk Bitcoin.\n\nWat erg uniek is aan Loki Casino is dat er een Nederlandse versie van hun website beschikbaar is, dat is voor ons mooi meegenomen. Helaas is de klantenservice wel in het Engels, en de spelletjes ook. Loki Casino beschikt, naast een enorm slots aanbod, ook over een live casino en sportsbook sectie. De odds die ze bieden zijn competitief, en dit bitcoin casino nederland is dus een aanrader voor Nederlanders die sportweddenschappen willen plaatsen met crypto.\n\n\n\nSpinch Casino wordt beheerd door de casinogroep Bets Entertainment N.V. Dit bedrijf runt meerdere bitcoin online casinos, en is in het bezit van een licentie van de KSA van Curaçao. Spinch is dus een veilig en betrouwbaar online casino bitcoin.\n\nIedereen die een nieuw account aanmaakt bij Spinch kan de welkomstbonus claimen. Dit is een drievoudige storting met een gecombineerde waarde van 255%. Hiermee kan je maximaal €600 aan bonustegoed en 150 gratis mee vrijspelen.\n\nDe welkomstbonus van Spinch is niet zo hoog als sommige andere aanbieders op deze lijst. Maar wat Spinch een uitstekende keuze maakt is de aantrekkelijke reload bonus. Hiermee kan je iedere vrijdag 77% van je storting, tot maximaal €1000, als bonustegoed ontvangen.\n\nWat erg uniek is aan Spinch, is de ‘Daily Quest’ promotie. Hiermee kan je kleine prijzen vrijspelen door opdrachten uit te voeren. Dit zorgt ervoor dat er altijd wat te beleven is bij Spinch Casino.\n\nWaar Spinch echt in uitblinkt, zijn de recensies van dit crypto casino Netherlands. Gebruikers op Trustpilot geven dit casino gemiddeld 4,3 van de 5 sterren. Dit zorgt ervoor dat de reputatie van Spinch als een betrouwbaar online casino bitcoin, vrijwel verzekerd is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoe open je een casino account in Nederland en begin je te spelen met Bitcoin?\n\nEen account aanmaken bij een bitcoin casino nederland werkt iets anders dan bij een Nederlands casino. Het proces is stuk sneller, en duurt meestal maar een paar minuten. Dit komt doordat je bij Nederlandse casino’s vaak gebruik moet maken van iDIN om je account aan te maken. Daarnaast moet je tijdens de registratie verplicht je ID aanleveren en spelerslimieten instellen.\n\nAls je een account aanmaakt bij een crypto casino nederland, hoef je eigenlijk alleen je e-mail adres en wat overige informatie aan te leveren. Vervolgens krijg je een bevestigingsmail in je mailbox. Zodra je op de link klikt, is je account aangemaakt en kan je al je eerste storting doen. Ik heb de stappen die je moet ondernemen om een account aan te maken bij een Bitcoin casino voor je op een rijtje gezet:\n\n– Ga naar de homepage van het casino en klik op de ‘Sign up’ knop. Deze vindt je meestal rechts bovenaan de pagina\n\n– Voer de nodige informatie zoals je e-mailadres, woonplaats, telefoonnummer en wachtwoord in\n\n– Kies van welke valuta, bijvoorbeeld euro’s of dollars, je gebruikt wil maken\n\n– Accepteer de algemene voorwaarden, bevestig je leeftijd (18 of ouder) en geef aan of je promotiemateriaal wil ontvangen\n\n– Klik op de ‘Sign Up’ knop om je registratie te voltooien\n\n– Na het maken van je nieuwe account, moet je je account bevestigen. Na je registratie krijg je een e-mail van het casino. Klik op de link in de mail om je registratie te bevestigen\n\n– Je account is nu in principe klaar om te gebruiken. Ik raad je wel aan om meteen je ID bewijs op te sturen. Dit is namelijk nodig als je geld wilt opnemen\n\n– Ga naar je accountinstellingen op de website van het casino\n\n– Klik op de ‘Account verification’ knop. Je kan nu een foto van je ID, paspoort of rijbewijs opsturen\n\n– Stuur een duidelijke foto van de voor- en achterkant op\n\n– Meestal duurt het een paar dagen voordat je ID goedgekeurd wordt. Wanneer dit is gebeurt, krijg je een e-mail van het online casino bitcoin\n\n– Je account is helemaal af! Je kan nu je eerste storting voltooien\n\n– Vergeet niet tijdens je eerste storting de welkomstbonus te claimen. Check even wat de minimum storting is om hiervoor in aanmerking te komen. Dit is meestal 10 of 20 euro\n\n– Voltooi je storting, je speelgeld wordt meestal binnen een paar minuten aan je balans toegevoegd\n\n\n\nBij een online casino bitcoin kan je wedden met valuta zoals Bitcoin, Ethereum of Litecoin. Voordat dit gebeurt, moeten deze echter omgezet worden naar euro’s of dollars. Bij een crypto casino Netherlands plaats je namelijk nooit inzetten met de daadwerkelijke blockchain crypto munt. Geld storten bij een bitcoin online casino werkt eigenlijk niet heel anders dan een storting met bijvoorbeeld iDeal.\n\nGa naar je account instellingen en begin je storting. Selecteer welke crypto munt je wilt storten, en hoeveel je wilt storten. Vervolgens krijg je een link of qr-code te zien. Deze verwijst je door naar je cryptowallet. Vervolgens kan je in de crypto wallet de benodigde stappen voltooien om de storting te voltooien.\n\nZodra de storting wordt voltooid, wordt er uitgerekend hoeveel crypto er uit je wallet moet worden gehaald om aan het gestorte bedrag te voldoen. Het geld staat binnen enkele minuten op de balans van je account, transacties met crypto zijn namelijk megasnel.\n\nJe winsten laten uitbetalen werkt eigenlijk niet heel anders. Ga naar het scherm voor opnames, geef aan hoeveel je wilt opnemen en in welke munt je het wilt laten uitbetalen. Vervolgens moet je het adres van je Bitcoin wallet opgeven. Zorg dat deze klopt, deze stap is namelijk niet terug te draaien. Klik op bevestigen als je tevreden bent. Het cash bedrag zal vervolgens worden omgerekend naar de munt die je hebt gekozen en worden uitbetaald.\n\n\n\nIk heb voor dit artikel een lijst samengesteld met de beste bitcoin online casinos. Maar ik kan me ook voorstellen dat je graag je eigen onderzoek doet. Als jij een online casino bitcoin wilt vinden dat specifiek aansluit bij jouw speelstijl en wensen, is het handig om verschillende aanbieders te vergelijken.\n\nDaarbij kan je het best letten op de volgende onderwerpen:\n\n– Bonus: kijk hoe hoog de welkomstbonus is en wat de doorspeel vereisten zijn. Check ook of het casino wekelijkse promoties heeft. Dit is vooral belangrijk als je van plan bent een langere tijd bij een enkel bitcoin casino online door te brengen.\n\n– Spelaanbod: bepaal voor jezelf waar je naar op zoek bent, bijvoorbeeld Megaways crypto slots, en kijk welke aanbieder het meest van dit soort spellen heeft. Kijk ook naar de uitbetalingspercentages van de spellen.\n\n– Uitbetalingsmethoden: kijk of het bitcoin casino nederland jouw gewenste betaalmethodes ondersteunt. Je kan bijvoorbeeld niet bij elk online casino bitcoin met Litecoin betalen. Een lijst met betaalmethoden vindt je meestal onderaan de thuispagina.\n\n– Klantenservice: test of de klantenservice van het casino btc goede informatie biedt en betrouwbaar is. Dit kan je simpelweg doen door een account aan te maken, een live chat te starten en wat vragen te stellen.\n\n\n\nIn Nederland is het niet toegestaan om te wedden met crypto valuta. Dit is dan ook niet mogelijk bij een online casino dat in het bezit is van een licentie van de Nederlandse KSA. Een indirect gevolg hiervan is dat aardig wat Nederlandse spelers uitwijken naar buitenlandse casino’s.\n\nLicentiehouders van een buitenlandse KSA zoals de MGA, UKGC of de CeG kunnen spelers wel in staat stellen om betalingen te verrichten met crypto. In deze landen is gokken met crypto namelijk legaal. Het is in Nederland illegaal om te spelen bij een cryptocurrency casino. De Nederlandse KSA is hier echter niet enorm streng in. Dusver heeft een Nederlandse speler nog nooit een boete of andere straf opgelegd gekregen omdat zij speelde bij een top bitcoin casino.\n\nHet lijkt erop dat de Nederlandse KSA vooral de oorzaak van het probleem aan wil pakken. Ze leggen namelijk regelmatig boetes op aan buitenlandse casino’s die zich focussen op de Nederlandse markt. Dit zet echter niet echt zoden aan de dijk: de boetes worden niet betaald en tot dusver heeft de KSA niet echt een manier gevonden om dit probleem op te lossen.\n\nDe Nederlandse KSA heeft wedden bij een online casino bitcoin illegaal gemaakt omdat dit niet altijd veilig is. Als je wilt wedden met Bitcoin is het dus essentieel dat je een betrouwbare aanbieder uit kiest. Als je niet weet hoe dit moet, kan je de paragraaf ‘Hoe evalueren wij de beste bitcoin casinos?’ van dit artikel lezen. Dit geeft je een duidelijk inzicht in hoe gok-experts beoordelen of een aanbieder te vertrouwen is.\n\nAangezien wedden met crypto illegaal is in Nederland, zijn gok liefhebbers die graag willen betalen met crypto genoodzaakt uit te wijken naar een crypto casino nederland. Spelen bij een online crypto casino zonder licentie van de Nederlandse KSA brengt altijd risico’s met zich mee. Als jij graag wilt gokken met cryptocurrencies, is het dus essentieel dat jij een betrouwbare aanbieder uitkiest.\n\nLet vooral op of de aanbieder een licentie heeft van een gerenommeerde buitenlandse KSA, zoals die van Malta, het Verenigd Koninkrijk of Curacao. Check vervolgens wat gok-experts en andere spelers van het casino vinden. Dit kan bijvoorbeeld op Trustpilot, of casino review platformen.\n\nToch zijn er ook verschillende voordelen verbonden aan wedden bij een online casino bitcoin. Deze sites hebben vaak de beste bonussen, meer crypto slots en unieke features zoals een bonus buy en autospins. Betalen met crypto valuta brengt ook een aantal voordelen met zich mee. De transactiekosten kunnen lager zijn, betalingen zijn erg snel en het is een geweldige manier om anoniem te gokken.\n\nHet aantal online bitcoin online casinos neemt ieder jaar exponentieel toe, en ik denk dat deze trend voorlopig door zal zetten. Of de Nederlandse KSA haar licentiehouders in de toekomst toe gaat staan om crypto als betaalmiddel aan te bieden, is moeilijk te zeggen. Momenteel is je beste keuze een veilig en betrouwbaar online bitcoin casino met een vergunning van een buitenlandse KSA.\n\nBij een online casino bitcoin kan je wedden met Bitcoin, Ethereum of andere crypto valuta. Het aanbod van top bitcoin casinos is ongeveer hetzelfde als bij Nederlandse casino’s. Bitcoin casino’s hebben echter vaak wel een grotere spel catalogus, de beste bonussen en VIP programma’s\n\nBitcoin casino’s werken eigenlijk precies hetzelfde als Nederlandse casino’s, alleen je voegt geld aan je balans toe door middel van crypto. Zodra je Bitcoin overmaakt naar je account, wordt dit omgezet naar euro’s of Amerikaanse dollars. Als je bijvoorbeeld geld inzet bij een crypto slot, zet je dus ook niet daadwerkelijk crypto in. Je kan vervolgens je winsten laten uitbetalen in Bitcoin, via je crypto wallet. Het is natuurlijk ook mogelijk om je geld gewoon direct uit te laten betalen, bijvoorbeeld via een bankoverschrijving.\n\nGokken met crypto is niet toegestaan in Nederland. Als je wilt wedden met cryptocurrencies zal je dus moeten uitwijken naar een bitcoin casino nederland. Bij licentiehouders van de KSA van Malta, Curacao en het Verenigd Koninkrijk mag je bijvoorbeeld wel met crypto gokken.\n\nwedden bij een online casino bitcoin heeft verschillende voordelen:\n\n– Een btc casino heeft meestal de beste bonussen\n\n– Crypto casinos netherlands bieden cashback bonussen aan\n\n– Bitcoin casinos mogen bonus buy en autospin features aanbieden\n\n– Een casino btc heeft vrijwel altijd een grotere spel catalogus\n\n– Een bitcoin casino nederland heeft mega snelle uitbetalingen\n\n– Crypto gokken bij een crypto casino is bijna geheel anoniem vanwege blockchain technologie\n\n– Het beste ethereum casino heeft vaak een VIP programma\n\nDe meeste cryptocurrency casinos ondersteunen naast Bitcoin ook andere cryptocurrencies zoals Litecoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin en Ripple. Voordat je een account aanmaakt bij een online casino bitcoin kan je even checken wat de beschikbare crypto munten zijn. Meestal vindt je hiervan onderaan de thuispagina een overzicht.\n\nBitcoin storten is eigenlijk net zo makkelijk als een iDeal storting. Dit zijn de stappen die je moet ondernemen:\n\n– Ga naar de website van de aanbieder en log in met je account\n\n– Ga naar je account instellingen en klik op de ‘storten’ of ‘deposit’ knop\n\n– Selecteer welke cryptocurrencies je wilt storten\n\n– Vervolgens kan je op een link klikken of een qr code scannen om doorverwezen te worden naar je crypto wallet\n\n– Bevestig de transactie in je wallet\n\n– Wanneer de storting voltooid is zal het geld binnen een paar minuten aan je balans toegevoegd worden\n\nBitcoin casino’s hebben net zoals Nederlandse aanbieders welkomstbonussen en wekelijkse promoties voor je klaarstaan. Het bonus aanbod is zelfs vaak beter. Een casino met een licentie uit Nederland mag bijvoorbeeld:\n\n– Geen stortingsbonussen van hoger dan €250 aanbieden\n\n– Geen cashback bonussen aanbieden\n\nBij een online casino bitcoin kunnen de bonussen tot duizenden euro’s oplopen. Loki Casino heeft bijvoorbeeld een welkomstbonus van maximaal €18.000.\n\nAls je bij een crypto casino nederland gaat spelen, is het belangrijk om een aanbieder te kiezen met een licentie van een betrouwbare buitenlandse KSA zoals die van Malta of Curacao. Vervolgens raad ik je aan om recensies van gok-experts en spelers te lezen. Dit kan bijvoorbeeld op Trustpilot.\n\nTrustpilot reviews geven je ook vaak een goede indruk van de voor- en nadelen van een casino. Check vooral wat andere spelers vinden van de klantenservice. Een betrouwbare klantenservice is namelijk essentieel tijdens het spelen bij een crypto casino.\n\nVrijwel alle casino’s hebben beperkingen voor stortingen en opnames. Hoeveel dit is, verschilt per casino. Vaak moet je bijvoorbeeld minimaal €20 storten als je geld aan je balans wilt toevoegen. Ook voor opnames is er meestal een minimum bedrag.\n\nNederlandse casino’s hebben vaak ook een maximum bedrag dat je kan opnemen en storten per maand. Dit verschilt echter per speler, deze zijn afhankelijk van je spelerslimieten. Opnamelimieten zijn soms ook aanwezig bij een online casino bitcoin. Deze zijn echter zo hoog, vaak tienduizenden euro’s, dat de meeste spelers hier geen last van zullen hebben.\n\nCrypto gokken is in Nederland niet legaal, je zal dus altijd moeten uitwijken naar een crypto casino nederland. Niet alle buitenlandse top crypto casinos zijn betrouwbaar, dus het is belangrijk dat je op een veilige casinosite speelt. Als je speelt bij een onbetrouwbare aanbieder, kan het voorkomen dat je je geld niet meer terugziet of dat het casino niet eerlijk met je spelersgegevens omgaat.\n\n",

    "content": "Testnets are designed to mimic the environment of mainnet to enable developers to test and troubleshoot applications without any value being at risk before mainnet deployment.\n\nIt’s generally considered good practice to test any contract code on a testnet before deploying it on mainnet—most onchain applications have copies deployed to testnets to enable developers to troubleshoot.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll show you how to get testnet ETH tokens on the Sepolia network to test your Chainlinked smart contract before deploying it on mainnet.\n\nSepolia is the recommended default testnet by Ethereum core developers for smart contract application development. Sepolia was initially launched as a proof-of-authority testnet in October 2021 by Ethereum core developers. The network later transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to mimic the operating environment of Ethereum mainnet.\n\nSepolia uses a permissioned validator set. Since it’s a relatively new test network with a small state, the network is quick to sync to, and running a node on it requires less storage than on mainnet or other testnets. These features are useful for developers who quickly want to interact with the network directly and run a node.\n\nCompared to other Ethereum testnets, such as Goerli, Sepolia’s total supply of testnet ETH tokens is uncapped, making it more likely that developers using Sepolia will continue to be able to access testnet tokens in the future.\n\nUsing the Chainlink Testnet Faucet, you can request testnet ETH tokens to test your Chainlinked smart contract on Sepolia.\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about testing your Chainlinked smart contract, visit the Chainlink Dev Hub.\n\nTo learn more, subscribe to the Chainlink newsletter, and follow Chainlink on Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit.\n\n",
